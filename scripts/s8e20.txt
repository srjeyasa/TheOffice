pam:  hey jim. stanleys back from the hospital today. can you sign his card?
jim:  oh, great.  “glad they didnt mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.” oh thats not good.
phyllis:  oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
pam:  its nice. its funny. it mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
jim:  stanley doesnt have a moustache.
pam:  yeah he does.
oscar:  pam, hit the brakes. stanley does not have a moustache. i misspoke. im not sure. i think he has one, now that- i think he has a moustache.
pam:  okay, phyllis sits across from him every day. phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
phyllis:  oh, i dont know. now i think he doesnt.
pam:  phyllis! what are you talking- the whole card depends on this!
jim:  okay, the mans worked here for 25 years. how can none of us picture his face?
angela:  ‘cause we come here to do our jobs. we dont stick our noses in other peoples business.
pam:  okay, which one of these looks more right? 
dwight:  neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. that said, the one on the left.
gabe:   guys, thats the elevator. what if its him?
jim:  okay, quick. who says moustache? 
dwight:  yep.
jim:  who says no moustache? 
gabe:   ah! ha ha ha!
phyllis:  he does have a moustache.
dwight: yes!
pam:  welcome back, stanley. 
robert:  “good morning, robert,” says no one because our receptionist is in florida.  pam!
pam:  oh! 
robert:  is this a video conference youre having with “drake, featuring swizz beatz”?
pam:  um, no, i was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
robert:  people, you should come to work already warm. nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-
nellie:  sorry, sorry, everyone, im late! but you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
robert:   nellie, really, nine fifty?
nellie:  oh, heres what happened. seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. i hear it. whack the snooze.
robert:  ah.
nellie:  nine minutes. bzz! off it goes again. whack! seven more times i did that. bzz, whack. bzz, whack! by the time i got up, it was ten minutes ago. no willpower. that is my curse!
robert:   ive never believed willpower was very important in a woman.
nellie:  ah ha!
robert:  i dont think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.
nellie:  oh, i assure you, i would have done. i did, and i will keep doing it.
robert:  no, no, no, no. theres something going on. some stress in your life.
nellie:  well, yes, uh… there is the whole moving to scranton nonsense. thirty boxes arrived yesterday from england and two trunks from florida. then i have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, god knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and i mean, no offense but are there a lot of irish people living around here?
nellie:  ugh! i hate that! no offense.
kevin:  none taken.
oscar:  actually, nellie, this monologue youre delivering is very offensive.
nellie:  oh! ay, carumba! the natives are getting restless!
stanley:  whos a native?
nellie:  uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. i would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. 
oscar:  what does that mean?
dwight:  okay, okay.
nellie:  if youd let me finish- or the squash court, or the supreme court. hmm?
robert:  nellie?
nellie:  yes, robert!
robert:  youre clearly under a lot of… stress with the moving and the work situation youve found yourself in.
nellie:  yeah.
robert:  lets help her out, shall we? go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm scranton hospitality. jim. dwight. take the day. help nellie move those boxes into her new place.
dwight:  why jim?
robert:  the rest of you, lets throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.
pam:  im sorry, were throwing a party for someone because theyre being horrible?
jim:  im sorry, were taking work time to move someones personal belongings into their new apartment.
pam:  im still not sure why this woman is even here.
jim:  why is she here?
andy:   two crazy kids on the journey of life.
erin:   going to pennsylvania.
andy:  on the road with my new girlfriend. but first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents cabin in southern pennsylvania.
erin:  oh. that must be nice.
andy:  mm-hmm. its a beautiful place. great place to let her down easy.
erin:  oh, no, no, i meant that it must be nice to have parents.
andy:  oh. hmm.
andy:   time to have a little kiss!
erin:  no.
andy:  mm. sorry. right. no kisses till the breakup is official.
erin: yes.
andy:  i believe in that.
erin:  yes. so do i.
andy:  i think thats important. that is important. bummer, but important.
erin:  important.
andy:  mm-hmm.
phyllis:  i cant believe hes making us throw a party for her.
pam:  i know, right?
oscar:  shes always late, shes always rude…
phyllis:  it kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
oscar:  yeah.
phyllis:  on purpose.
pam:  phyllis!
angela:   we should do it right here in the break room. 
phyllis:  order carrot cake. 
andy:  …and jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for erin than anything wrong with you.
erin:  well, andy, im upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and i knew you as a lover and ill remember you as a gentleman. okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
andy:  consider it nailed.
erin:  i think we should try again. this time, worst case scenario.
andy:  okay, here we go. jessica, im really sorry. i just need you to know-
erin:   what?
andy:  i just need you to know-
erin:  what is it? i didnt sleep well last night. 
dwight:   ugh! ow.
jim:  nellie, that reminds me. do you want this chair in the bedroom? ‘cause to be honest, i dont think its gonna fit through the door.
dwight:  dont listen to jim. have you ever seen him play tetris? “oh, i think ill just use this line horizontally. oh, i had no idea what a gift this line is.”
jim:  that was one time-
dwight:  i will get the chair in. watch the great schrutini work his magic.
nellie:  oh, no. really? magic? no, no, no. lets not go there. no, nothing is more repellant than magicians. bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. magicians are repulsive. next topic.
jim:   excuse me, one second. hi.
pam:  hey, whats up?
jim:  ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with dwight.
dwight:   haulin cube!
jim:  thats moving boxes. we just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
pam:  so were planning this party for nellie, and were gonna make it really bad.
jim:  sounds like every other party.
pam:  no. were gonna make it like a prank. like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
jim:  oh! hire a magician.
pam:  what?
jim:  trust me.
pam:   okay.
andy:  wow. theres a lot of cars here. this is just weird.
lauren:   andy! hey, what are you doing here?
andy:  hey, lauren. look at you.
lauren:  well, i know. look at me.
andy:  i was just on my way back from this business trip, thought id stop and say hi to jessica.
lauren:  aww! 
andy:  why is erin with me? thats a great question. she is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
lauren:  oh. god.
erin:  so, im erin. hi.
andy:  yep. this is erin.
lauren:  nice to meet you.  well, jess went out for a run but shell be back soon. hey ladies, andys here!
erin:  okay andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is jessicas friends and theyve been drinking during the daytime. should we go?
andy:  yeah. uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, i think we should probably just-
lauren:  oh, jess!  look who stopped by after his business trip!
jessica:  andy! hey!
dwight:  i wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in england. i really should have a tweeter account.
jim:  yes, you should.
dwight:   ooh.
jim:   “nellie, dont open, stupid. love, nellie.”
dwight:  i have to see these shoes.
jim:  i doubt that theyre sh-
dwight:  oh!
jim:  whoa. who is this guy?
dwight:  heres the two of them taking a hike. im guessing hes some kind of friend.
jim:  boyfriend.
dwight:  heres the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the eiffel tower. im guessing hes some kind of close romantic friend.
jim:  like a boyfriend?
dwight:  you read my mind.
jim:  yeah. whoa. heres one with his face whited out.
dwight:  hmm. maybe someone threw a pie in his face. new theory- hes a hated italian politician.
jim:  better theory. this is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
nellie:   oh.
jim:  oh, nellie. im so sorry. we were just…
nellie:  i see youve discovered benjamin. thats what i call my box full of photos of henry.
dwight:  why not call…
jim:  shh!
nellie:  god. we owned this flat together. then one morning, just like that, he was gone. he ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
dwight:  thats awful. what kind of restaurant.
jim:  dwight!
nellie:  i couldnt afford the flat myself. so i sold it at a loss. ah, but whats ten years of bliss down the draincompared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
jim:  im so sorry. these must be very painful memories.
dwight:  if it would help you to forget, i could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
nellie:  thank you. no. look, jim, dwight, please, dont tell anyone about this.
jim:  no, no. of course. just one quick question. was this um, halloween, or…
nellie:  god, no. thats the most embarrassing thing of all this. what kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
jim:   you know what, pam? i was thinking maybe we should change course here. lets give up on all this mean stuff.
pam:  what? no! no, i just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. you dont have a copyright on pranks. i might be better at this than you.
jim:  no, thats not what i-
nellie:  jim, could you give us a hand?
jim:  absolutely. yeah.  call it off, pam. call it off, okay? its way more complicated than you think. cancel the magician. trust me.
pam:  oh, okay. okay, i will. 
angela:  pam, we have a great idea.
oscar:  listen to this.
angela:  were going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. its gonna make everyone sick.
pam:  or what if…
angela:  okay.
pam:  we discuss…  the idea of doing the party totally normal. like, not mean. just a regular party.  not mean.
angela:  i knew shed crack! i wanted to leave you out, you know.
oscar:  were in far too deep. we cant change course at this point.
pam:  what are you talking about? yes we can.
oscar:  what i mean to say is we dont want to.
phyllis:  toots, were not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
lauren:   suck it! 
erin:  andy-
andy:  itll be fine. just act natural. do you want a gummy penis?
erin:  no, uh, ill just have some gummy bears.
andy:  these are delicious.
erin:  but… theyre penises.
lauren:  and we come to matthew. the guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together. 
andy:  ew! aww! that seems gross at first blush, right? but relationships are always more complicated than you think. i mean, we dont know matthews history with this other woman. maybe she saved his life.  i dont know.i just- i dont think we should rush to judgment about matthew. maybe we dont pop that one.
party guests:  no, pop it. pop it! 
jessica:  hey.
andy:  hey.
jessica:  sorry. its kind of a madhouse.
megan:   ahh!
andy:  oh! ah, megan.
megan:  you are one of the good ones, nard dog.
andy:  aww.
megan:  no, really.  wheres my andy?
jessica:  i dunno.
andy:  oh, hes out there.
megan:  aww. are you going to sing for us?
andy:  well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so…
megan:  thats not like you. thats not like you. come on, sing! sing!
andy:   by yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes…
pam:  okay, theyre almost here- what? come on. if you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? 
darryl:  oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. andy was jelly roll. mike was dennis the menace. ryan was douche bag.
ryan:  hey, thats not a code name. thats just an insult.
oscar:  plus everyone would know who you meant.
ryan:  yeah!
pam:  no, thats a great idea. lets have a code name. how about mondays? i hate mondays? mondays are the worst?
angela:  nobodys named monday.
ryan:  hey, how about we go with pam? simple, easy to remember.
pam:  ‘cause theres someone already here named pam.
kevin:  shh, here she comes!
all:  hey!
phyllis:  welcome to your party.
creed:  everybody get comfy now. this first songs over a half hour long. 
creed:  best gig ever. they asked me to play only originals. i said, “have you heard my originals? theyre terrible.” they said, “even better.” i said, “i get it. its an ironic party for nellie.”
erin:  maybe we should just go.
andy:  no. i gotta do this. hey jessica, could i talk to you?
jessica:  uh, yeah, sure. whats up?
andy:  uh, maybe we could talk in private?
jessica:  uh, yeah. what is it?
andy:  well, first just let me say that i hope when im done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
jessica:  youre breaking up with me?
andy:  uh, no. no. you always do this. you twist my words around. part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
jessica:  oh my god. are you leaving me for erin? you said she wasnt relationship material and she wasnt as good as me, but its her, isnt it?
andy:  whoa! that? no. okay. you want honesty? super-honesty time. im gay.
jessica:  what?
andy:  i am gay, and i prefer men.
kenny:  i knew it!
andy:  you did not, kenny!
kenny:  you invited me to go shopping with you.
andy:  i like hanging out with you. youre a cool guy. which proves my point. that im gay.
jessica:  andy, youre not gay. i mean, we were… together. and you seemed pretty excitable.
andy:  well, i was faking it. i had to fake it every time. i had to imagine that i was in a steam room with john stamos.
jessica:  i cant say it doesnt make sense…
andy:  well… i mean, i was good at hiding it, but-
jessica:  look, its fine, andy. i didnt think we were gonna get married or anything. i just… im just upset for now.
andy:  understandable. and im really sorry. i really am.  so… we should probably… go.
robert:  this humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. excellent.
oscar:  to nellie bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
robert:  cheers.
nellie:  why thank you.
oscar:  pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
all:  cheers.
angela:  nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day i imagine how happy id be if pam died. 
jim:  oh. well. i feel that as someone who knows pam only a little bit… enough. a good amount. not the most, though. i would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe theres some stuff in her past that you guys dont know about thats a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
creed:  we hate pam. we hate pam.
all:  we hate pam! we hate pam!
magician:  so weve established-
jim:  no. no.
magician:  -that you guys hate pam. do you ever wish she would just… disappear? 
pam:  oh! 
erin:  that was a really rough scene.
andy:  right? rough scene.
erin:  yeah.
andy:  oh… at least we can kiss now.
erin:  oh, yeah. 
andy:  you know, that stuff that i said about you to her… i did- thats just- i had to say it. you know, i was dating her at the time.
erin:  yeah. yes, of course. ah… i feel really tired.
andy:  yeah.
erin:  probably from seeing that turkey.
andy:  oh yeah.
erin:  when we drove by the farm. oh. always does it.
magician:  are you nellie? oh, i think youre my volunteer. come on over here, huh?
jim:  oh, ill do it. i will volunteer.
robert:  no, nellie, she-
jim:  ill do it.
magician:  oh! big guy, huh? hows the air up there? watch out for… birds.  all right, lets uh- lets do some card magic. now, what i want you to do is… i want you to pick a card just by looking at it. do not say what it is.
jim:   its the four of hearts.
robert:  oh, no, you-
magician:  looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? no hablo el cardo, senor? hmm? ha. all right, the card is picked. now sir, will you please shuffled the deck?  you didnt just do that on purpose, did ya?
robert:   why is jim treating the magician poorly?
magician:  little known fact about me. before i was a magician, i used to work at a rope factory.
jim:  not true. ‘cause thats not a real place.
magician:  but i never could seem to figure out those knots.
pam:  thats not a real knot. when you pull on it, it disappears.
magician:   what the hell? all right, wheres phyllis? whos phyllis? look. this is really uncool, okay? i put on a clean show here-
dwight:  okay scram, wizard.
magician:  what?
dwight:  you heard me!
magician:  huh!
robert:  well nellie, im sorry. if id known jim and pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-
nellie:  well, i thought it was quite fun. in fact, i think theyre brilliant employees, in their own way. dont you see what i see?
robert:  interesting. yes. no, yes, i see that. great work, team. great party.
kevin:  you think this is a great party? this cake has vegetables in it. like a salad bar, robert. how do i get this taste out of my mouth?
erin:  what? why are we-
andy:  i just gotta do one thing. 
megan:  oh. hello. hey everybody, look whos here.
jessica:  what are you doing here?
andy:  hi. super-duper honesty time. im not gay. in fact, im so not gay, im in love with a girl. her name is erin hannon and shes right there. shes sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
megan:  why the hell did you come back here?
jessica:  go away.
kenny:  get lost!
woman:  get out!
andy:  okay.
lauren:  youre done!
andy:  bye guys.
lauren:  get out! you ruined my party! who does that? are you kidding me?  yeah, run away!
kenny:  youre disgusting!
lauren:  i cant believe youre not gay! 
kenny:  yeah get out of here.
various:  dont come back. 
erin:  uh-oh! 
various:  you dont even know how to drive! bye andy! loser! nice car!
pam:  hey hank.
hank:  yes maam.
pam:  i thought i was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
hank:  yes maam. i got my eyes open.
jim:  well, turns out he actually made it up there.
hank:  what? that aint right.
pam:  yeah, he came and went.
hank:  wait a minute! you said it was a magician, right?  you dont think he couldve used… it couldnt have been…
pam:  lets just- lets go.
jim:  night-night.
