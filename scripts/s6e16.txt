pam:  i just wanted to check and see if theres anything you needed before i went on my maternity leave…yeah, im pregnant…great, well, ill write up the order.okay, thanks
dwight: wait a minute!you cant do that.you cannot exploit your baby for sales
jim:  hey, did i tell you we were going to have a baby?oh, thank you very much.im excited.oh, definitely
dwight: no, no!you need to come by your sales honorably
pam: there is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.people like it
dwight: hey there.dwight schrute here.listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? …yeah, i could sure use the money.my cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.oh, its just horrific.thedoctor says hed never seen it beard so quickly.okay.
dwight: i need a baby.ill never outsell jim and pam without one.also, ive been noticing a gaping hole in my life.sometimes i wake up cradling a gourd.
pam: kevin, youre such a gourmand
kevin: i cooked my way through julia childs cookbook, and now, im halfway through the twilight cookbook.last night, i had edwards corn flake chicken
pam: hmm.
kevin: pregnant pam and i, we get hungry at the same times, so weve been eating together a lot.not all meals.just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
kevin: i thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.one last ultra feast
pam: mmmm, that sounds great.what are you thinking
kevin: i think it should be a surprise
meredith: oh, getting there, huh
pam: no, no.i still have time.
pam: im having contractions, but theyre irregular and far apart.so im not really in labor, im near labor
jim: yeah, were slow-playing it because of our stupid hmo
pam: if we check in after midnight, i get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors
jim: not to mention the extra nights sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if its crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.and i do not plan on helping unless its a boy
pam: i cannot wait for that joke to be over.
pam: ooh
michael: oh, oh, oh!contraption!shes contrapting!okay, you know what?i think i should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.i am a licensed, classy driver in the state of pennsylvania.i gassed up the car
jim: michael
michael: actually, i put diesel in this time, trying to save some money
jim: michael, you shouldnt have done that
michael: happy to do it.also, i did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office
pam: you know the babys not going to live here, right
michael: well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too
jim: hmm, that logics air-tight, but unfortunately it wasnt conceived here.burning man, port-o-potty
michael: oh, yuck!tmi!how was it?i dont want to know.tell me later.lets go!lets go!hospital
pam: okay, okay, were not going to the hospital.we are waiting until midnight
erin: ooh, spooky.but why
jim: because the insurance company only covers two nights
pam: everythings fine.we have plenty of time
nick: well, you dont want to wait too long, pam.otherwise the babys going to become a teenager in there and youll be up all night, from the rock music
michael: shut up, nick.what a weird thing to say.weird i.t. nerd.dont get revenge on me, nerd
angela: what are you looking at
dwight: ha, nerd.
kelly: did you know that labor can last weeks?then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals dont work, and you can poop yourself.
dwight: bare my child
angela: excuse me
dwight: i want to have a child for business reasons and i want you to be the mother.if you agree, say nothing.if you disagree, say anything…very well.lets meet at 4:00 pm at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
jim: thats seven minutes.here we go.this is happening.come on
pam: hold on, hold on.it isnt midnight yet
jim: are you serious?pam
pam: no, the doctor said every five to seven minutes
jim: i…pam, please
pam: im going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight
andy: yeah, no, you really should.because if your babys born tomorrow, hes going to have the same birthday as butt-mud brooks.my old roommate
pam: did you hear that?butt-mud brooks
jim: okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart
pam: five minutes apart.
jim: so, the plan was seven minutes.but were calling an audible, because thats her call.because shes the quarterback.im just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
pam: okay, stop watching me
jim: okay, crazy.i think i have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers
pam: mm-hmm
jim: well not until friday 20% off toner cartridges, thats a big deal.while were on the subject, why dont i just run you down to the hospital and well just do a quick check
pam: not until midnight
andy: guys.word of advice.speaking as a former baby.dont get too hung up on baby names.i was named walter jr. after my father until i was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds
erin: i thought you said your younger brother was named walter jr
andy: my brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the walter jr. name, so they gave it to him.i was given andrew, which they got out of a baby name book
jim: you know, its getting real crowded in here.maybe you guys should all go back to work because the days not out yet
michael: no, no, no, no, no.you know what?you cant tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore
jim:  okay, i feel like this noise is going to prevent pam from being able to listen to her bodys signals
pam: actually, the distractions are good.i mean, i dont think im going to make it until midnight if im just sitting here thinking about it
michael: distractions are good!that means conference room, five minutes!no, no, five seconds!right now, right now!conference room!topic, potpourri!lets go!
michael: um, i am sort of a master of distraction.when i was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how i was always able to distract others in class.try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
michael: the purpose for this meeting is to take pams mind off of whats going on inside of her body
andy: can we do sleight of hand tricks
michael: i will allow that
andy: yes!can anyone do those
stanley: im going to go look at the internet
jim: oh!oh, alright.thats a good one
pam: oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.just, um, keep talking
michael: okay
kelly: oh my god, pam, you are a woman warrior
pam: oh, thanks, kelly
michael: does anybody have anything?anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills
pam: yes, this is the only time im ever going to make this request
michael: yes, phyl
phyllis: i can put on lipstick the way molly ringwald does in the breakfast club
michael:  nope, nope, i dont think anybody wants to see that
andy: i can do the evolution of dance-dance
michael: that sounds good!do you need some music, or…?okay
andy: nope, actually music would just throw me off.i need complete silence.okay…youre clapping.i need complete silence.totally threw me off, so im going to have to start over.evolution of dance-dance
ryan: “you let me in your bed.but now, i sleep alone.trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.
erin: affirmed.seattle slew.secretariat.citation.assault.count fleet.whirlaway.war admiral.omaha.gallant fox…and…i know this.uh…the jockey was johnny loftus.sired by star shoot.

michael: yeah, happy times.come on.lets have happy times

erin: um, stimulate the nipples
michael: okay, nobody touch pams nipples.think of pams nipples as tobys grundle
kevin: her shirt is touching them.maybe we should cut holes in her shirt

kevin: yes.
andy: why was i hiding behind the plant?ha, well, in college, i took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.uh, kids would gossip about me, so i would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.and then, uh, they would say things like “oh, this guys going to fail this class,” or, “whats this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?”and then i would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, “oh, you think all i do is hide behind plants and spy on people?busted.” …oh, the reason?the reason i was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that i thought that erin and kevin were kind of hitting it off, and…i was jealous.
pam: yes
pam: um, yeah, that would be great
jim: yup.really great.whens she available
clark: actually, uh, im the consultant.got milk?ha ha.alright, lets see what were working with
pam: so, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch
clark: ill get that for you
pam: oh, thank you.is that um, i cant tell if im really producing.i dont know if shes getting anything
clark: okay.let me feel here
pam: okay
clark: yeah, its quite full.why dont you put your hand on top of my hand
pam: okay
clark: when youre feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a c.uh, does that hurt
pam: no, i mean, it feels…pressure
clark: okay
jim: are you sure it doesnt hurt
pam: no.it just feels like pressure
clark: okay, well.feel how im flicking the nipple?like that
jim: yup
clark: stimulate it
jim: yeah
clark: alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh
jim: perfect
clark: and you can just…the baby should grab on to that
jim: i think she will
