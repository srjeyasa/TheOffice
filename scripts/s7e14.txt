andy:  and you didnt invite any of us?
ryan:  we are getting divorced, andy! this is such a raw time. 
kelly:  god baby, you know, peoples reactions to this… maybe we made a mistake.
ryan:  no, with the messed up laws in this country, i dont want to be married until everyone can be married. 
oscar:  you know what ryan, i talked to the other gay guys, and were ok with it. we agree its fine if you got married. 
ryan:  no oscar, not, not until everyone can!
kelly:  ryan, i changed my mind. 
ryan:  ok fine, you know what, this actually isnt amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. who is on my side?

dwight:  problem solved everyone. space orphan and princess nincompoop are off to rescue michael. unbelievable. im going. you drive, i got a car full of fox meat.
pam:  cute.  very funny, everyone. who wrote captions under my doodle? im not even kidding. theyre pretty good.
oscar:  which on in particular?
andy:  yeah, which one? 
pam:  well the first one has a surprise factor. “im a suck suck-suckidy sabre!”
andy:  boo-yea! 
gabe:  no no. no no no. 
pam:  but, ah, i suppose the second one is the better written line. 
oscar:  you suppose?
darryl:  whats it say? 
oscar:  “im suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.” 
gabe:  ok.  no no no. 
kevin:  red gloves. 
darrly:  keep it real. 
pam:  you guys, if i knew you wanted to do a caption contest, i would have drawn something more challenging. 
darryl:  and i will take you all down.
andy:  you?
darryl:  ive been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. not once i have used the real captions to family circus. that crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason: me. 
andy:  oh it is on like genghis khan wearing sean jean in buton. 
pam:  yes. you guys, i have the perfect idea. ok, it will just take me ten minutes. 
andy:  woo-hoo. 
kevin:  i cant wait.
dwight:  male. caucasian. forties. black hair. facial type: marsupial. 
erin:  he answers to michal. michal g. scott. michael j. fox. mr. fox. the incredible mr. fox. 
attendant:  yeah, he just left. 
holly:  which way did he go?
dwight:  hey hey hey. let me answer this. stupid question. he went back to the office, obviously, which is that way. 
holly:  oh really? you dont think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
attendant:  shes right. he went that way. 
dwight:  alright. dont get a swelled head. youre no tracker. lets ride.
michael:   hey you guys. listen to me. dont get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. look over there. see? they look cute.  hello! you guys are so beautiful. youre so colorful. i wish i could understand you. thats a metaphor i guess.  you are disgusting. youll never find love. yekkk.  do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen?  im being serious. seriously.
pam:   dunder mifflin, this is pam. 
dwight:  has michael checked in?
pam:  oh, hey dwight. 
dwight:  i asked you a question.
pam:  no, he hasnt. 
dwight:  goodbye.
pam:  no, wait. hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? we have ice cream so i thought… 
dwight:  pam, this isnt a shopping trip. 
erin:  no.
dwight:  this is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
pam:  ok. i, just, when you are done or any time its convent, i just thought since you are out… 
dwight:  pam, im obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up. 
pam:  ok, well it wasnt obvious so… 
dwight:  no word from michael. 
holly:  oh.
pam:  ta-da!
kevin:  ok, its two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island. 
oscar:  ok. i got one. 
pam:  yeah?
oscar:  yes! 
gabe:  ok, im sorry but i am going to have to shut this down. 
office:  boo! 
meredith:  why?
gabe:  unless we can all agree to some ground rules. its either that or i can fax this to joe and let her decide how to proceed. 
darryl:  gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game. 
gabe:  number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for. 
oscar:  irony is such a critical… 
gabe:  number two: no pop culture references. 
pam:  seriously? 
oscar:  wow. 
gabe:  i think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who dont get the reference, making them feel like the other. 
darryl:  wrap it up, gabe. 
gabe:  ok final thing, and this is a fun one: instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, lets all try using sticky quips. all right? new, from dunder mifflin sabre.
gabe:  sticky quips are fun. they are safe. they are handy. i like to use sticky quips as regular post-it notes when i am in a fun mood.  not every day.
gabe:  go get em. start quipin. 
oscar:  pam, i think im going to send you an im. 
pam:  oh! ok. 
darryl:  send me one too. 
andy:  yeah, yeah. put me on that. 
phyllis:  c.c
kevin:  ditto.
michael:  hello. i would like a hot dog please. now, i dont have any money so here is what i would like to do. i leave you here with my watch, and i come back later to pay for the hot dog. 
hot dog guy:  im not a pawn shop. 
michael:  well i understand that but this is a $45 watch.
hot dog guy:  wow. 
michael:  with that i can buy… half the menu. 
hot dog guy:  i cant just go giving away hot dogs. 
michael:  all right. what do you do with the hog dogs that you dont sell?
hot dog guy:  throw em away. 
michael:  well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why dont you just throw one away now into my mouth?
hot dog guy:  no. 
michael:  okay. youve just lost my business.

dwight:  excuse me do you speak english? we are looking for a man. michael, this tall, black hair, caucasian… 
erin:   its michael! 
waiter:  he just left. 
erin:  you knew. 
holly:  what? no. dwight asked if i wanted an egg roll. what… what are you implying?
dwight:  uncanny. put a pin in that.  which way did he go? that guy! when he leave here, which way did he go? we looking for him.  this way, this way, this way? i dont know. do you know?
waiter:  i think he was heading downtown.

pam:  guess not. 
gabe:  oh, come on. my rules could not possibly have been that oppressive. 
darryl:  you crushed our spirits, gabe. congrats. youre a big man, huh? take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people.  
gabe:  hey…

andy:  oooohhh.
gabe:  “darn it bob. i told you not to buy a sabre brand lifeboat.” 
kevin:  nice!
gabe:  no, not nice. terrible. doesnt even include the fact that theyre dogs. 
andy:  do the next one. 
gabe:  “wake up, fred. the power cord on your sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and youre dreaming youre a dog on a desert island. 
darryl:  dreaming hes a dog on a island. 
gabe:  uh, excuse me, excuse me. how does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
phyllis:  well, if you think its so easy, gabe, why dont you try it?
gabe:  umm… “you dont have to sniff my rear end anymore, bob, im the only one here.” ha. 
oscar:  thats tasteless, gabe. 
gabe:  tasteless?
oscar:  tasteless. 
gabe:  more tasteless than this…”is that a palm tree or did gabe get skinnier? either way, lets pee on it.” 
pam:  ladies and gentlemen, i think we have a winner. 
phyllis:  yes. 
kevin:  yes, well done! 
oscar:  whos is it? who wrote that? 
phyllis:  yeah, who wrote it?
angela:  please. it was easy once i decided i wanted the dog to piss on gabe.
erin:  where did he go, holly? 
holly:  i have no idea. 
dwight:  do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? is there a little bird thats chirping to you, “this way, this way”?
holly:  i dont know. 
dwight:  okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. what is michael seeing right now? can you tell him that we miss him? michael were coming for you! 
holly:  will you stop! there has been a few coincidences, thats all. 
dwight:  all right then. someone propose a plan. 
erin:  okay. we fan out…
dwight:  not you, erin. 
holly:  stop looking at me like that. okay, lets just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below. 
dwight:  that is the stupidest idea ive ever heard. no. tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next. 
holly:  look, im not playing. im gonna go look for him. 
erin:  good. we dont need her. 
dwight:  right.i can do this on my own. i can think like michael. all right… im deep below the oceans surface in a submarine. a torpedos coming right at me. no. damn it, thats just my own imagination.maybe hes bowling.
holly:   michael? 
michael:  hi.  how did you know i was up here? 
holly:  what are you doing up here? 
michael:  i got turned around. i thought i could see dunder mifflin. 
holly:  dunder mifflin.

holly:  i missed you too. 
michael:  really? 
holly:  yeah. 
michael:  can i kiss you?
holly:  yeah. 
michael:  okay.
phyllis:  maybe thats not the best one. keep reading. 
gabe:  uh, it was. 
meredith:  maybe it wasnt. 
gabe:  “oh, thank god. i had a horrible nightmare that i was stuck in america with gabe.”
andy:  oh! 
phyllis:  no, thats not the one i was thinking of. keep going.
gabe:  “i know what it smells like but i didnt roll in anything. its from listening to all of gabes bull.  “isnt this the perfect romantic getaway, erin? sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? im gabe and im a weirdo.” 
andy:  
gabe:  “gabes mom… hmm… gabes mom? wait. tall woman? looks like gabe? yeah, i banged her.”
phyllis:  yeah, there you go.
