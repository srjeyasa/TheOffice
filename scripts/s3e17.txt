michael:  can you confirm that the straps are tight?
dwight:  yes. but this  seems to be…
michael:  and now, the chains.
michael:  a lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. and thats why so many other people in my class were kids. self fulfilling prophecy. its um, its really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
michael:  magic magic magic magic magic magic… and now, michael the magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage.  can he do it? i dont see how he can.

michael:  ahhhh!
kevin:  is everything ok, michael?
michael:  yes.
michael:  i cannot tell you how i plan to escape. other than by using magic. that is the magicians code. separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key…
michael:  alright.
dwight:  
michael:  ready? come on guys. early worm gets the worm. 
jim:  another worm? like, are they friends?
dwight:  its early bird gets the worm.

roy:  i cant. my brother, he just unloaded the jet skis and kinda took a bath, so… were going to go get hammered.
pam:  ok, well, were going to a bar. hey. you have to come to stuff with me. im serious! if youre going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things. 
roy:  ok.
pam:  i have decided that im going to be more honest. im going to tell people what i want. directly. so, look out world, cause ol pammy is getting what she wants. and, dont call me pammy.
michael:  beauty. thank you sir!
dwight:  salad.
michael:  thank you. 
dwight:  you dressed exactly like the servants.
michael:  shut up. ok, change shirts with me.
dwight:  wait. i dont think yours will fit me.
michael:  i dont care. oh, wow. here. dont put my jacket. dont give me that.
dwight:  that would have been really embarrassing.
michael:  yes.
dwight:  crisis averted.
michael:  ok.
pam:  oh, that duck is so cute.
kevin:  hey pam.
pam:  hey guys.
kevin:  oscar. angela.
michael:  hi.
michael:  actually, its polite to arrive early. and smart. only really good friends show up early. ergo de facto. go to a party really early. become a really good friend.
michael:  oh, um, potato salad.
dwight:  its from both of us. 
michael:  no, its not.
rachel:  wonderful, lets, ah, see where we can put this. ok.
michael:  oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
michael:  its been sitting in my car all day. sun beating down on the mayonnaise. just, you never know.
pam:  kevin, you and stacy set a date yet?
kevin:  yeah. 
kelly:  oh my god, when is it?
kevin:  its complicated. i would appreciate some space on this.
roy:  hey.
pam:  hey. you made it.
roy:  you said it was important, so… hows it going?
kenny:  whats up, pam. 
pam:  hey kenny, sorry about the jet skis. 
roy:  you guys, uh, want a round, on me?
everyone:  yeah.
roy:  yeah? get you a drink. 
kenny:  thanks man.
angela:  no thank you, roy.
dwight:  oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? thats feces.
michael:  what are you looking for? you bring dip?
jan:  im sure that its catered. i need you to sign these, michael. its a waver of some of your rights. you should read it carefully. it releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. you get a copy, i get a copy, and a third copy goes to hr. 
michael:  awesome. im going to frame mine. i could frame yours too.
jan:  you realize this is a legal document that says you cant sue the company. 
michael:  over our love.
jan:  ive never told you that i love you.
michael:  you dont have to, jan. this contract says it all.
jan:  i am taking a calculated risk. whats the upside? i overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. downside? i, uh, date michael scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
jan:  whats this over the “i”?
michael:  its a heart.
jan:  why is this so hard? thats what she said. oh my god. what am i saying?
michael:  i love this woman!
jan:  oh, no. michael, please. michael, please.
dwight:  do you ever watch battlestar galactica?
dan gore:  no.
dwight:  no? then you are an idiot.
rachel:  hello michael.
michael:  rachel. boy, you clean up good. place looks great with all the lights on. and everything.actually looks bigger with people in it. its weird. so…
david:  jan, glad you could make it.
jan:  of course, of course, david. do you remember michael scott?
david:  of course i do.
jan:  from the scranton branch.
michael:  jan and i are lovers. it feels so good to finally say that out loud.
jan:  david, can i, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please. 
rachel:  excuse me.
michael:  ok.
pam:   oh.  no. actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
bartender:  oh, sorry.
man:  so did the merger go smoothly, or?
michael:  it did. like butter. mike myers, snl. you should ask karen, she was one of them. 
karen:  im the only one left. everyone else was either fired or quit. and there is one in anger management. 
michael:  yeah, but youre great now, right? were all great. arent we great?
jan:  were good.  michael, stop. please stop that, ok?
rachel:  can i get anyone anything, or?

dwight:  does that include the garage?
michael:  dwight, wow. thats not appropriate.
dwight:  im just…
david:  i dont know

michael:  david, how much did this house cost?
dwight:  these old colonials are great, when theyre sound. id love to take a look around.
rachel:  ill show you around. 
dwight:  cool, lets start with the banisters.
karen:  hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
jim:  yep. 
karen:  thats drake. and just so you know, i dont want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
jim:  oh, ok. cool. thanks for telling me. 
karen:  and it didnt end well.
jim:  gotcha. alright.

rachel:  uh, yes. 
dwight:   good.
jim:  well, it was nice meeting you guys. take care.
karen:  well, if youre wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, its because i kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated. 
jim:  oh. hadnt noticed.
karen:  really? i thought it was so obvious. im glad it didnt make you uncomfortable.
jim:  no, it was before i knew you so, its fine.
michael:  this one really smells like vanilla. check that out.
jan:  its nice.
michael:  you and the misses should join us at sandals jamaica next christmas. 
jan:  i, michael, i think david probably wants to spend christmas here with his family. 
michael:  oh yeah, they dont allow kids at sandals. they are persona non gratis… there. but its fun. its an awesome place. you would not believe how low this girl can limbo.

david:  whats ah, whats with jan and michael? 
jim:  i dont know. where to begin? my ball.
dwight:  the chimney is in decent shape. not great. i found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
roy:  what?
pam:  i want us to make it. i want a fresh start.
roy:  thats awesome. thats what i want. 
pam:  oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there cant be any secrets between us. 
roy:  i didnt do anything. ask anyone, i totally could have and i didnt at all.
pam:  just listen. remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? i kissed jim.
roy:  what?
pam:  he told me how he felt and i guess i had feelings too, and we kissed.
roy:  jim came on to you?
pam:  just listen.

roy:  dont yell?!
pam:  this is over.
roy:  yeah, youre right. this is so over. you kidding me, pam!? come on! god!
kenny:  damn jet skis!
michael:  our first fight. if this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle…
jan:  i feel sick.
michael:  you didnt have any of the potato salad did you?
jan:  no, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. it was wrong and it was exciting. maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
michael:  well, if thats the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly. 
jan:  please dont cry.
michael:  im not going to cry. i feel like it but i am not going to. why dont you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces. 
jan:  it was never a love contract, michael and besides, i have already given a copy to david and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as i was handing it to him.
michael:  i want the house, jan. i want the picket fence. i want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
jan:  i didnt mean it. i was…
michael:  whatever.
jan:  tired. im tired. and i didnt eat enough. and, and, thats all. that was it.
michael:  thats all, you didnt mean it?
jan:  thats all. i didnt mean it. thats all. im just saying i didnt mean it. 
michael:  i love you, jan.
jan:  ok.
