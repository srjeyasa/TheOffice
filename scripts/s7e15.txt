gabe:  and what do we have here?
erin:  from my secret admirer. thats you!
gabe:  come on.
gabe:  i dominate valentines day. i practically make romance into a science.
erin:  “roses are red. violets are blue. look in the vase to find your first clue.” oh, my gosh. its a romantic scavenger hunt!
gabe:  oh, close. its a romantic treasure hunt. a scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. this is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. common misuse. good luck.
erin:  but, theres no clue.
gabe:  well, get to work.
erin:  i cant, cause theres no clue.
gabe:  the puzzle is the clue.
erin:  oh.
oscar: 
michael:   are these numbers correct?
oscar:  the numbers are correct, michael.
michael:  okay.
oscar: 
michael:  are you… are you sick, oscar? do you need to go home? ‘cause youre grossing me out.
oscar:  i jus… i just need a signature.
jim:   there you go. thanks.
pam:  how much did you give him
jim:  big tip.
pam:  wait. i dont have my scarf.
jim:  what?
pam:  im missing my scarf. oh. 
jim:  we decided to have a valentines day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with cece and avoid the valentines day dinner thing. its a whole thing.
pam:   yeah, lunch was wonderful!
jim:  shh.
pam:  um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue… station. and what else was there?
jim:  um, bottomless champagne.
pam:  yes. never found that bottom, did we?
jim:  no.
erin:  psst! psst!
andy:  whats up
erin:  are you good at jigsaw puzzles?
andy:  are you kidding me? its all i did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
erin:  okay.
andy:  but if there is a romantic thing with gabe, i should probably
erin:  oh! no, no, no, no. its not weird at all. you have your new girlfriend. i have gabe. this is just as friends.
andy:  well, okay then.
erin:  yes
andy:  at least until stanley calms down.
erin:  oh, is he
andy:  d…d…d…d…dont look. i accidentally did his sudoku.
erin:  andy.
jim:   all right, i will fax over it to you. whoop. i will fax it over to you. okay. thank you.
dwight:  okay, my name is j…j…j…j…j…j…j…j jim halpert and i will fax it in to you… under you. ill fax it under you. oh, excuse me. i just p…p…p…p pissed my pants. not really. i didnt really. 
jim:   wait.
dwight:  youre just filling that out right now. that wasnt meant for me. i will not be your valentine.
jim:  aww, nuts. 
angela:  i dont know if anyone else feels this way and dont get me wrong, i love michael and holly, and maybe im being overly sensitive, but… the pda.
oscar:  yes! the freaking pda!
angela:  uh-huh.
oscar:  thank you! i mean, im thrilled for them.
angela:  no one is more thrilled for them than i am
oscar:  yes, yes, absolutely.
angela:  …but its totally inappropriate.
darryl:  yeah, its a little much.
phyllis:  mm-hmm.
darryl:  obviously, so happy for them both.
oscar:  so happy. yeah.
kevin:  i dont know, guys. i, for one, enjoy watching them, because
angela:  no, stop! just dont.
oscar:  kevin!
kevin:  can i finish? can i finish? is that okay? i was saying…i enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
everyone:  
angela:  god! kevin!
erin:  so tell me about your new girlfriend.
andy:  shes neat. uh, i met her at darryls cousins party. we were the only two white people there.
erin:  aww, cute.
andy:  hey, look at that. done.
erin:  thats gabes boom box. come on. we have to go find it.
andy:  i wish you well on your quest.
erin:  no, come on.
andy:  aww, i mean
erin:   come on!
andy:  okay.
erin:  ha!
gabe:   i hear them kissing all the time. its this horrible plipping sound. you know, its like chinese water torture. just… like its coming from my own head.
michael:  sit. okay, just close your eyes.
holly:  ohh. can you get lower
michael:  oh, yeah.
holly:  a little lower.
holly:  i cannot keep myself from michael. everything he does is sexy. he has this undeniable animal magnetism. hes a jungle cat. the man exudes sex. he can put both his legs behind his head.
gabe:  thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.
michael: 
gabe:  yes
michael:   yes. michael scott, dunder mifflin. what is the purpose of this meeting
gabe:  seeing as its valentines day, i felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.
michael:  perfect. yes. it is quite apro-propriate. carry on.
gabe:  first things first. an office romance is permissible. not something youd expect to hear from corporate. well, guess what. sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.
ryan:  speaking of, gabe, i dont see erin at this meeting.
meredith:  uh, i also dont see andy.
kevin:  oooh.
jim:  ooh! boom! face!
gabe:  i get it. andys slamming my girlfriend. very funny. what i do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or pdas. pdas are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. perfect example. look at jim and pam.
pam:  yeah. what? us
gabe:  they dont touch. they dont kiss. you would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.
jim:  did it!
pam:  yeah!
jim:  love it. keep it goin.
gabe:  okay. so, pdas. thats gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh
kevin:  booby honking.
gabe:  yeah, booby honking. sure.
kevin:  butt honking.
gabe:  butt honking. yeah, all the honking.
creed:  the one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap
gabe:  sure. basically, theres no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. ahem.
oscar:  are you guys listening to this?
michael:  what, are you talking about me and holly?
pam:  yeah!
gabe:  maybe you find your own chair.
holly:  so we kiss occasionally.
oscar:  not occasionally. all the time.
phyllis:  yeah, and its not just the kissing. its the flirtatious whispering.
stanley:  the flirtatious tickling.
michael:  whispering and tickling have their place in business.
darryl:  that thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
michael:  i… okay, yeah, thats pretty hot. i will give you that. look, you are all hypocrites. you all do it.
dwight:  michael. confession: i have done pda in the office.
michael:  thank you.
dwight:  ive had intercourse in the office.
michael:  all right.
dwight:  as has angela
angela:  dwight!
dwight:  as has ryan. as has kelly. as has meredith. as has phyllis. as has darryl. as has creed.  as has michael and as has holly.
kevin:  as has kevin
angela:  with who
kevin:  she goes to another school.
michael:  okay. fine. no more pda.
oscar:  good.
michael:  you win. but heres what we are going to do. we are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
angela:  no.
michael:  anything goes.
oscar:  just leave it how you said
dwight:  michael, thats absurd. what if two couples want to go at the same time?
michael:  okay, then we have two closets. no, no, were gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. yes
dwight:  and what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
michael:  pro.
dwight:  yes
michael:  what? problem solved.
michael:  no, no, its great. i love working at dunder mifflin, a division of taliban enterprises.
pam:  thats weird. i mean, thats weird to have sex in the office. thats where you work, right?
jim:  mm-hmm.
pam:  you know, youre in a meeting, and nobody knows that youve had sex there, except for you and him.
jim:   ew.
erin:  dont mind us. you keep working.
darryl:  okay. ill keep working.
erin:  oh, my god. its a song.
andy:  whoa.
erin:  what do you think is on it?
andy:   we should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make darryl mad.
erin:   not if were talking like this. i think its okay. he doesnt seem to hear us.
andy:  i think he can hear us.
andy:   that makes sense, cause i feel like id be able to hear us at this level.
erin:  darryl.
andy:  darryl is a jerk.
erin:  no, hes not.
andy:  no, im just testing if he can hear.
darryl:  i can hear you.
andy:  oh. okay.
erin:  okay. then no more talking. lets just play the song.
boom box:   the temp at night. the temp at night. the temp at night. the temp at night.
andy:  the temp at night
erin:  what do you
darryl:  you got it. pick it up. take it out.
andy:  pi
darryl:  pick it up.
andy:  okay.
darryl:  take it out. pick it up. pick it up. pick it up. take it out.
andy:  right. okay.
holly:  sorry to interrupt. forgot to collect my things.
michael:  ah, the old “leave behind.” oldest trick in the book. good thing its working.
holly:  oh, no. michael, i dont want to make people uncomfortable.
michael:  since when is comfort the most important thing? i mean, i dont… i dont sit on your lap because its comfortable. i sit on your lap because i like the way your thighs feel on my butt.
holly:  yeah, but if theyre uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
michael:  oh. okay. well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then well stop.
holly:  okay.
michael:  holly and i are like romeo and juliet. and this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
michael:  hey, you know why people here are complaining? they are jealous of two people in love on valentines day.
holly:  two people in love?
michael:  i love you.
holly:  wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? weve only been dating for a week. do you mean you love me like, “oh, hey, theres holly. i love that girl.” or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me
michael:  i love you-love you.
holly:  wow, you love me-love me. i love you-love you.
michael:  i am really disappointed in the offices policy on pda at this moment. i love you.
holly:  i love you.
michael:  yeah, whatever. no big deal. just the hottest girl in the world loves me.
andy:  okay, ryans the temp. what does he do at night?
erin:  i guess we just have to wait until night and see.
andy:  oh, or maybe not.
erin:   oh. cool.
andy:  how romantic is this?
erin:  super romantic.
andy:  right. do you see a clue or
erin:  yeah. did you not see it?
andy:  oh, my gosh.
erin:  hanks.
jim and pam:  hey!
andy and erin:   hey.
andy:  no time to chat.
erin:  sorry.
jim:  well, we were just looking for ryan, so hes not here.
ryan:  hey. youre looking for me
pam:  oh, yeah, we were. we were just looking to say hi. so hey.
ryan:  no you werent.
pam:  no, we werent.
ryan:  you wanted to have sex in my office.
pam:  no.
jim:  definitely not. thats disgusting.
ryan:  no. its… its cool. just try to put everything back were you found it. text me when youre finished. ill be out here.
jim:  hey, you dont have to
pam:  that was so embarrassing. im gonna die.
jim:  that was really rough.
pam:  let me make something clear. jim and i have never and will never have sex in the office.
jim:  no, because the office isnt what id consider a romantic place.
pam:  besides, we have something those other people dont have, which is a home and a bed.
jim:  and a shower.
michael:  hello, holly.
holly:  hello.
michael:  here, shake. no
holly:  no, dont touch.
michael:  no, we cant.
holly:  no touching.
michael:  no touching. ah, im trying not to touch you.
holly:  oh.
michael:  oh.
holly:  almost got you.
michael:  oh, no, so close. oh. no, we cant do that. we cant do this. ohh.
holly:  youre not touching me.
michael:  i dont know what your body feels like cause i cant touch it.
oscar:  okay, this is much worse than before.
kevin:  yeah, i agree. this is nasty.
michael:  grab you here.
holly:  and here.
michael:  i will grab you here anyway. 
gabe:  you have to cut it out.
holly:  okay.
michael:  never.
holly:  you said you would.
michael:  i did say i would, but i was wrong. i cant stop. you dont what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. it is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
gabe:  no one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. but with you two, its reaching the level of a complex. i can think of three explanations. one: youre taking mdma. street name, ecstasy. ive done it, and i know the feeling.
holly:  no, i dont think so.
gabe:  number two: youre desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before toby comes back from jury duty and holly has to go back to nashua. or three: youre at an age where your sexual climaxes arent as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.
michael:  yes, it was that. its that one.
holly:  yes. number three.
holly:  give me all your money and take off your clothes.
michael:  were not supposed to pda.
holly:  come one. nobodys looking. whats wrong?
michael:  i havent thought about you having to go back to nashua.
holly:  maybe we didnt want to think about it. we can make it work. well date long-distance.
michael:  thats what we said last time. remember? we broke up on the drive. hows this gonna be any different?
holly:  we werent in love last time.
michael:  i was in love with you.
holly:  im not saying it wont be hard. but we can make it work. thats what she said.
michael:  
erin:  oh. one erin special, please.
hank:  heres your bottle of sparkling cider.
andy:  hey.
erin:   thats my favorite.
hank:  im now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mind-hunt break and look for a heart or some  in the break room when youre through.
kevin:   hey, buck up, buddy!
darryl:  make that face he likes.
dwight:  hey. hey. come on. youre hurting him.
michael:  its like a time bomb
dwight:  shh.
michael:  …is ticking down. when it goes off, no more kissing. no more hugging.
dwight:  just hush.
michael:  sexual time bomb.
dwight:  just rock. shh.
michael:   boner bomb starring jason statham. or we go against type with an eisenberg or a michael cera
dwight:  movie idea?
michael:  no.  saving the world has never been this hard.
dwight:  okay. shh. have you talked to her about your feelings? women really go for that crap.
michael:  no, i cant talk to her. i cant even look at her without thinking about it ending.
dwight:  kevin! do more stupid faces.
kevin:  which one? i have a lot of stupid faces.
dwight:  i dont know.
michael:  do the monkey face.
dwight:  do the monkey face!
michael:  i love that. i love that face.
dwight:  good. he loves it. good. jump. jump up and down.
michael:  no. the monkey!
dwight:  go back to the monkey!
michael:  dont do the squirrel. throw your poop.
dwight:  hurl your feces.
michael:  thats good.
dwight:  good.
michael:  thats good. hes throwing it.
dwight:  they really do that.
michael:  i know.
erin:   b-9
andy:  b-9
erin:  like a benign tumor.
andy:  maybe its just more like, “be mine.
erin:  oh, yes. theres a note. “a little cookie for you, my miss. but the real treasure is your valentines kiss.
andy:  mm.
erin:  mm. oh. were suppose to…mmm
andy:  hmm. 
michael:  holly. hey.
holly:  hi.
michael:  holly, i love you so, so, so much. and i think we need to break up.
holly:  what? what are you talking about?
michael:  actually, its valentines day. shouldnt be doing this today. ill talk to you tomorrow.
holly:  no, were gonna talk now. youre not breaking up with me.
michael:  youre gonna go back to nashua eventually, and i cant handle it. so lets just…lets
holly:  what if i said it wasnt up to them?
michael:  who
holly:  the company. nobody knows our future, but its not gonna be decided by the company. its not gonna be decided by anybody but us. what we are is up to you and me.
michael:  okay. okay.
michael:  ladies and gentlemen, i have an announcement to make. as of today, officially, holly and i are moving into together. yay!  thank you. thank you. oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. you could not stand in the way of true love, my friend
oscar:  are you kidding? i wasnt trying to break you guys up.
kevin:  better luck next time, pal.
michael:  well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for pda here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best valentines day present that a person could receive. so i bid you all adieu.
holly:  you do?
michael:  i do.
oscar:  go on. kiss each other already.
kevin:  suck it, oscar. this must kill you.
oscar:  i just told them to do it!
jim:  what?
pam:  no.
jim:  no. we took a walk.
pam:  we took a walk.
dwight:  my perfect valentines day? im at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations i made over six months ago.
ryan:  anybody can be prince charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. but you know what impresses me? when a guy can do that no days a year.
kelly:  flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me…
kevin:  pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
michael:  what are our plans for tonight? umm
holly:
