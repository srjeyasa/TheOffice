michael:  and the same thing goes for quarterly reports.they are unreadable.theyre just numbers and boring and blech.so what i was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? and… when we have a good quarter, fireworks? or a racecar?  doesnt have to be a racecar.use your imagination
jim:  theres this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like its heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.and we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. okay.i believe she thinks she saw it
pam: i saw it.i saw it, and it was amazing!who said i didnt see it?did jim say that i didnt see it? i saw it

michael:  you know what?i dont understand when you all talk at the same time
kevin:  oscar, talk to him
oscar:  michael, theres a very big difference between these two pizza places.both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.which one did you order from
michael:  pizza by alfredo
all: 
michael:  okay, okay, whats better?a medium amount of good pizza?or all you can eat of pretty good pizza
all:  medium amount of good pizza
michael: 
kevin:  oh no, its bad.its real bad.its like eating a hot circle of garbage
phyllis:  you can pick one of these things.its unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this
angela:  it should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do
phyllis: 
angela:  ow
phyllis:  that seemed to shut her up
andy:  are you looking for dinner and a movie?because youre not going to find it in that box
andy:  just so happens that i know where you can find it, but again, not in the box
andy:  angela, are you hearing words that im saying
angela:  what
andy:  hello
angela:  i have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.so now ive got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now theres no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing thats made of ice.and my upper back itches, and its itched all day, and i cant reach it, and kevin had greek food for lunch again
andy:  they say you should never mix business with pleasure.really?well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates

pizza guy:  hey.sixty-three fifty, and thats not including tip
michael:  right, i have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty
pizza guy:  the half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas
michael:  yeah, i told them on the phone that i was ordering eight pizzas
pizza guy:  i dont care what you told them on the phone, thats our policy
michael:  you didnt actually think i was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza
oscar:  its not pizza
michael:  okay, it doesnt say it anywhere on the coupon, and if its policy, it should say it on the coupon
pizza guy: 
michael:   what do you mean hmm-um
pizza guy:  not my problem
michael:  it is your problem.thats no way to do business, okay? i ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so i would like eight pizzas for half-off.end of story
pizza guy:  great story.its sixty-three fifty, and thats not including tip
michael:  im not giving that to you
pizza guy:  well then youre not getting youre pizzas
michael: no, no youre not going anywhere.youre staying here until we figure this out
pizza guy:  what
michael:  you know what?this young man needs to learn thats not how you treat people.i dont care if its pizza.good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.you dont just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.right now, get in the conference room
pizza guy:  im not going in there
michael:  yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.please, thank you
pizza guy:  this is stupid
michael:  no, you dont even know what stupid is.its about to get all stupid up in here
stanley:  you find anything
kevin:  we think its a straight forward kidnapping
oscar:  stanley, could you look up “accomplices”
stanley:  why cant you guys do it
oscar:  because were looking up jail time
stanley:  fine
dwight:  ive seen this kid before. hes one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp

pizza guy:  what kind of business is this
dwight:  were a paper company.the best paper company in the whole wide world
michael:  alright, dwight, knock it off.you better think about what you are doing young man
pizza guy:  you better think about what youre doing
michael:  no!im an adult, i dont have to think or do anything.youre a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks hes better than everyone else, because hes some hot shot, and you dont know anything about sales.so stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay
pizza guy:  sales
michael:  yeah sales, you sell pizza.last time i checked thats called sales
pizza guy:  youre such a loser
dwight:  what did you just call him
pizza guy:  a loser

pizza guy:  a loser
michael:  alright stop, stop making him say it!you just made this worse, a whole lot worse
dwight:  i can make him talk, michael
all:  michael, michae
michael:  stop talking all at once
jim:  you need to let him go
michael:  let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson
jim:  yes
michael:  you know what jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions
jim:  yes, but not by kidnapping
michael:  im not kidnapping him, im keeping him until i get what i want
jim:  as a hostage
michael:  i think youre over-thinking it
jim:  i think youre under-thinking it
michael:  yes, is alfredo there?can i speak to a manager then?okay, can you tell the manager that im keeping his delivery kid until i get a discount on the eight pizzas i ordered.yes, i know it is not on the coupon.also i would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our
jim:  ransom
michael:  trouble.okay, alright
jim:  what did he say
michael:  he said no
jim:  so, we should let him go
michael:  no, no
jim:  okay
dwight:  listen up kid.i dont like you, but because some town in switzerland says so, you have rights
angela:  i have to hang these

dwight:  hey
kevin:  whats going on
jim:  michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands
michael:  mister overdramatic, whats up kevin
kevin:  were getting hungry out there.were all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.we would like to order some good pizza, from alfredos pizza cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end
angela:  i needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour
meredith:  i think it looks good
angela:  thats why youre not in charge meredith

kevin:  good pizza
jim:  yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors
kevin:  different stuff
jim:  which ones this? perfect
jim:  do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk
pam:  yeah, enjoy this moment, because youre never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate dwight
jim:  and thats when i knew. you
pam:  you came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and theres no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt youre about to eat has expired
jim:  that was the moment that you knew you liked me
pam:  yep
jim:  wow, can we make it a different moment
pam:  nope
manager:  can i start talking?is this thing on?give me a signal when you want me to start
ryan:  and now from my old hometown, scranton pennsylvania, my former boss, michael scott
michael:  hey, i just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole
ryan:  always a jokester.how about that image?crystal clear
pizza guy:  if anyone out there is listening, im being held here against my will.im a minor
angela:  ow! what are you doing
andy:  you said your upper back itched
angela:  i didnt ask you to scratch it
andy:  look angela, i know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now ive repulsed you, but i like you
angela:  im not dating you
andy:  so, angela is stubborn as a mule, shes giving off fairly strong vibes that shes not interested
dwight: 
andy:  but do i like her or not, because if i like her, then i cant back down
dwight:   if youre going number one youve got ten more seconds
michael:  hey, have you seen jim
kevin:  i guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out
dwight:  ahh-chaa
michael:  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing
dwight:  im just scaring him.the trick is to make him think youre going to do something to him
pizza guy:  i can hear you, man
dwight:  shut up, or im going to punch you in the throat
michael:  hey, hey, hey stop it.stop it now, god. oh my god, oh my god, no, no, no.i kidnapped a kid
dwight:  you had to, what other choice did you have
michael:  i could have paid for the pizza

michael:  oh my god, oh my god
michael:  this is michael
ryan:  hello michael, this is ryan, first off thanks for the shout out
michael:  youre breaking up. i cant hear you
ryan:  why is there a kid on your webcam saying that hes being held against his…
michael:   mmm-kay.i want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent
dwight:  what will you do
michael:  i will open the door

andy:   what do you think of angela?theres just something about her.all that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.
andy:  no.i will not be playing it “cool”  with angela.let me tell you a little story.when i was seventeen, i was waitlisted at my number one school.even though i was a legacy, and i had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, i was waitlisted.did i wait, on that list?no, i did not.i busted into the admissions office and i  sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school .and guess what?i.got.in.and heres the kicker.that school?cornell
michael:  whats wrong with me
pam:  excuse me
michael:  i want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me. dont avoid this.i know youre dying to say it, so just say it
pam:  sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence
michael:  what, no.no.okay, bags.i have bags under my eyes, pam.i didnt see it at home, i didnt see it in the bathroom, i didnt see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light
pam:   the city mirrors, or the…
michael:  the big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?the big round things
pam:  the ones for drivers to check their blind spots
michael:  yes.i have bags under my eyes, and i cant go to new york like this!what do i do?what do i do
pam:  put cold tea bags on your eyes
michael:  really
pam:  yeah
michael:  thats it
pam:  mmhmm
michael:  all right!martha stewart!you can be martha stewarts receptionist!very good!i will be tea baggin it.nn… no.
michael:   do i feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that i was invited to?not at all.because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.of course, at that point, i will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into.what are you gonna do?
kevin:  im a little mad, that i dont get to go to the party in new york.but thats mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
oscar:  i was going to be in new york tonight, to go to the met, but i had to cancel.because angelas party is mandatory.
creed:  i go to new york all the time, to visit my buddy frank.hes a mole person
meredith:  angela, what kind of music
angela:  uh… something cool that ryan doesnt know about yet
meredith:  how am i supposed to know what that is
angela:  i dont know, but standing heres not going to give you the answer.go.
angela:  tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.which means, it will be compared to denise stimms party in buffalo.any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors doeuvres platter.and denise proves that with every party she throws.oh, and denise?stop telling people your hairs naturally curly.we all know you get perms
kevin:  kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the persons will, so michael asported him. have you ever been aspor
oscar:  dont.
dwight:  hey.the way i see it, its getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friends pizza discount.so whattaya say?oh, so thats how its gonna be.well, i can stay here all night if i have to.ive done it before
pizza guy:  im not scared of you.
kevin:  in every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you dont know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza
toby:  the lady cop acted like shed never pulled someone over for driving too slow.and i tried to get out of it with the famous toby flenderson 10,000 watt smile.  it didnt work.
toby:  damn it
kelly:  is that traffic school
toby:  yeah
kelly:  because were not supposed to be doing personal stuff at work
toby:  yeah
kelly:  because yesterday when i was taking an online quiz about trying to find my ideal weight for my frame, you said that was inappropriate
toby:  i remember
kelly:  just reiterating what you said to me
toby:  thanks kelly.
oscar:  you know the octagon sign means stop
