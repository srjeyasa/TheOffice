dwight:  oh, ugh.  what is this, a meatball? really? 
jim:  its always more fun to mess with dwight with an audience. that was usually pam so now that shes out i had to find someone else. turns out that stanley is quite the comedy fan. but not everything makes him laugh. he has very specific tastes. through a painstaking process of trial and error, ive found out what he likes. and its really weird.
dwight:  jim, come on! thats so juvenile! what the- 
stanley:  youve been meatballed! 
dwight:  ugh.
stanley:  are you ready for some meatball?
dwight:  aw, man.  this is not very clever, jim.
jim:  i know.
stanley:  look for your stapler!
dwight:   really jim? really? very funny.
stanley:   oh okay. good night.  whats the haul?
dwight:  thirty-two meatballs.
stanley:  good day.
dwight:  that idiots been feeding us for a week.
stanley:  well never have to buy meatballs again.
erin:   dunder mifflin. jessica, hi! how are you? oh yay, thats so great to hear.
erin:  im not going to be one of those exes who cant move on. they have their life and i have mine. im taking an italian class. so far ive learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini… well its not so much a class as a restaurant, but i do monday, wednesday, friday from seven to nine.
erin:  i will patch you through right now. you sound really pretty today. okay.
andy:  jessica! i love you! thats a message from my mom.
andy:  my parents met jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. i know, whoa! pump the breaks, bernard, too early! i get it. i just, you know, im just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. i havent proposed to anyone in years… mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but…
jim:   whoa, looks pretty nice. got a little bit of a shining vibe, though.
oscar:  oh, who needs a house that size?
dwight:  big. stupid. pure chump bait.
robert:  im selling the house, actually.
jim:  you know, theres a glare from over here… oh wow, thats magnificent.
robert:  its mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and ive got the most expensive house on the market. the one percent are suffering too, people. i wanted it to be my playboy mansion. a temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue… this was hot on the heels of eyes wide shut, mind you. then i met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. now shes left me and forced me to sell the place. the ultimate insult? theyre calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room.  does my turmoil amuse you, jim?
jim:  im sorry, i thought you were making a joke.
robert:  what could you possibly have found funny in what i said? what was the joke you thought you heard?
jim:  i guess i thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
robert:  oh yes. how hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. very funny, jim. i get it.
andy:  um, im getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
robert:  a beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. i think im entitled to the occasional bad day.
andy:  well, please tell susan we all say hi.
kevin:  dude, what if, since youre feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? 
oscar:  kevin, no.
robert:  what, as some sort of last hoorah?
kevin:  yeah. all of us in the pool, saying hoorah. maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
robert:  you know i suppose someone should enjoy the place before i hand it over to the staging experts at remax tomorrow.lets try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. lets just call it a get-together. and lets say no food.
kevin:  hey oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
oscar:  that was you, kevin.
kevin:  it was me.
meredith:  you going tonight, kiddo? cause i can give you a lift.
erin:  oh, i dont know, meredith. it seems like you shouldnt drive maybe ever.
meredith:  its no problem. you live right near me.
erin:  how do you know where i live?
meredith:  andy followed you home after the christmas party.
erin:  why?
meredith:  he wanted to make sure california didnt put it in you.
erin:  oh. come on.
erin:  wow. andys such a weird stalker. following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? i should get a restraining order. 
angela:   oh, it is warm.
cathy:  its almost too warm.
gabe:  im feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half.
ryan:  oh, so close. eighty-one.
gabe:   well, well say its eight-two and itll be our secret.
cathy:   hey, late guy.
jim:  hey. wow. just stopping by. got another party to go to. a wife and two kids at home party.
andy:  oh.
jim:  dj pam halpert is spinning some serious radio disney tonight.
jim:  youre looking at the master of leaving parties early. they key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. i dont mean to brag, but new years eve, i was home by nine.
jim:  robert, just wanted to grab you one second. this place is amazing, by the way.
robert:  you should see the whole thing.
jim:  i bet i should.  thats beautiful, im going to email that to you.
robert:  im just about to give the tour.
jim:  all right-
robert:  join us. you must see what you were laughing about.
jim:  i must…
jessica:   wow.
andy:   yeah, its pretty serious poolage.
jessica:   what are you doing?
andy:  hmm? flicking a bug off my wiener. 
jessica:  gross. im getting a drink. do you want anything?
andy:  no, im good.
erin:   funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. hi.
andy:  hi.
erin:  how is everything? hows your car?
andy:  its great. you know. reliable. great mileage.
erin:  is that so? how about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? maybe get caught in the rain?
andy:  well, i cant. im going skiing with jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.
erin:  oh, like a goodbye trip.
andy:  no. what?
jessica:  hey.
erin:  hi.
erin:  i guess andy isnt totally over his current girlfriend. but, if he was jealous once before then maybe i can make him jealous again. just not with robert. he told me he was a ride i wouldnt survive, and i believe him.
darryl:  val. you made it.
val:  yup, yup.
darryl:  uh oh, look at this. red plastic cup, red plastic cup. how about that?
val:  you know, you are just as dumb at night.
darryl:  mmm. 
andy:  all right, theres- this would be no problem. i could swim under, one breath.
jessica:  no, show me.
andy:  okay.
jessica:  dive in right here.
andy:  in a minute. in a minute.
jessica:  okay. you dont know what youre doing.
andy:  a minute would be cool.
erin:  hey, dwight snoot.
dwight:  what-
erin:  what you doing?
dwight:  im relaxing. scram. 
erin:  ow.
andy:  hey, stanley. um, what happened to my pants?
stanley:  i moved them. pants only need a chair if theres a person in them.
andy:  where… 
erin:  come on, dont you want to play?
dwight:  oh really?
erin:  yeah.
dwight:  yeah, you want to play you little hick? 
kevin:  whoa.
angela:  dwight! oh my gosh! dwight!
robert:  here we have the parlor. i imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. this was the gateway. you enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it youre simply a penis, a vagina, hunger, ache. susan used it as a pilates studio.
oscar:   holy cow!
robert:  wine collection.
oscar:  how many bottles? three hundred?
robert:   about twelve hundred. what the hell, grab a bottle. less inventory for the lawyers.
oscar:  toby! chateau margaux ninety-five. you know your wine.
toby:  well, and you have a… yes, a- d- another chateau.
ryan:  robert, you are too kind.
robert:  oh.
gabe:  too kind doesnt begin to cover it.
ryan:  with ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
gabe:  and gabe-y makes three.
jim:  robert, thank you. thank you for this. thank you for all this. this nights been magical.
robert:  jim, come see this next room. i think you especially would like it.
jim:  really? why?
robert:  i dont know. maybe not. just come.
erin:   oh!
dwight:   you regret attacking me now, hick? huh?
erin:  stop it. dwight, i was flirting with you. i was trying to use you to make andy jealous.
dwight:  im not going to help you. why would you choose me? because im mighty? because im the manliest man in the office? ill do it. 
erin:   oh dwight!
erin:   stop.
dwight:  you stop.
erin:  no, you stop.
dwight:  no, you stop.
erin:   is he looking?  oh. you can stop.
dwight:  okay, you can stop.
erin:  no, no, no, hes not looking.
dwight:  no, you can stop.
erin:  you can actually stop.
kelly:  whoa, you guys, i just found this insane engagement ring. is anyone missing this?
meredith:  the main stones missing.
kelly:  i dont know. it looks pretty great to me.
robert:  i pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. then i met the vegan.
jim:  good night.
oscar:   to the kitchen!
all:  to the kitchen!
robert:  to the kitchen. onward!
oscar:  toby, whats compelling about this is the note of persimmon. right?
toby:  note? its a symphony.
oscar:  okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
toby:  i would love that.
toby:  toby, you are playing a dangerous game. guess im through the gateway now, though, right?
darryl:   you know, i dont think ive ever been in this exact angle before. i was scared at first, but i like it.
meredith:  you guys got to try this pool. no top scum, no band-aids. this thing is choice.
val:  you in?
darryl:  yeah, sure, sure. ill be right in.
darryl:  ive been working out. but, the problem is, ive been building muscle underneath. and that top layer hasnt burned off yet. awkward stage.
dwight:   ah, mmm. so good. now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. do it. now rub it in. oh, yeah, thats so good. ah…
erin:  andys not even looking. i think sexy eating is a dead end.
dwight:  damn it.
erin:  what is the most romantic possible thing?
dwight:  we can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
erin:  dwight, thats just- thats really perfect. thank you.
both:  yes! 
angela:  youre in my way!
erin:  andy, dwight and i challenge you and jess to a chicken fight. winner take all.
dwight:  chicken fight!
andy:  no thanks.
erin:  dang it! what the heck already?
dwight:  hey, cathy. chicken fight!
cathy:  okay, yeah. whos going to be my partner? wheres jim?
kevin:  im right here!  cold. cold. come on, cath.
dwight:  yeah- oh!
erin:   yes! woo!
dwight:  woohoo! yes!
erin:  dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. we work so well together.
dwight:  i know. i could just bang you right now.
erin:  hes not looking.  hey!
robert:  i had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. total waste of two bears.
jim:  to both these bears.
ryan:  to both these bears.
toby:  bears.
oscar:  to both these bears.
robert:  when i put in the screening room, i bought three movies: caligula, last tango in paris, and emmanuelle 2. last two movies i actually watched in here marley and me and on golden  pond.
ryan:  i mean, its clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
gabe:  yup. we could watch some right now if you want. i got a korean film on my ipod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
andy:  kelly, thats a crazy ring you found.
kelly:  yeah, thanks. im really glad i found it.
andy:  i cant believe youre wearing it. are you not superstitious at all?
kelly:  shh. of course im superstitious. what are you talking about?
andy:  the ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? am i just being silly?
phyllis:  oh, i dont think youre being silly.
kelly:  oh god. 
andy:  you know what, i can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
phyllis:   then another woman will get it. we cant allow that. we have to destroy it.
jessica:   come on. lets chicken fight those two.
val:   how was that?
kevin:  okay. watch my toes. 
darryl:  hey val. want a beer? it might taste better than that pool water youve been drinking.
val:  no, im good. thank you.
darryl:  cool.
val:  cool.  does darryl not swim?
kevin:  thats racist! i dont know. but i would say, by looking at him, no, darryl does not swim.
jessica:   yes!
andy:  yeah!
dwight:   maybe we should take a little break.
erin:  dwight, weve got this. i promise. i will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
dwight:  okay.
erin:  one more?
andy:  yeah!
jessica:  yeah! great! 
erin:  mush, mush, mush! come on!
dwight:  go!
erin:  go! okay. yeah.
jessica:  here we go!  yes!
andy:  yay!  whoa!
kevin:  wow!

jessica:  i cannot believe it either.
erin:  ive got this!  charge! go! go! 
andy:   dwight are you okay? hey, damn it-
dwight:   erin, did we win?
erin:  sure. sure we did.
dwight:  youre lying. we didnt win.
erin:  hey, hey, hey dwight. its okay. just rest. just rest.
kelly:  youve broken up your last couple, you evil ring. do it. 
angela:  were in the pool!
meredith:  shut it, angela.
dwight:  ugh. same old party, same old people. am i right? reminds me of phylliss birthday.
andy:  ooh, do not remind me of phylliss birthday.
dwight:  i know.  but boy, that erin. she sure is a ripe little tiger, isnt she? rroww! and to think, i always thought of her as a second meredith. respectfully, i dont want us walking into a similar angela kind of situation.
andy:  mmm.
dwight:  so i just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with erin.
andy:  last i checked, im with jessica. and i like to get my monog on. its monogamy for my hog ‘n me.
dwight:  not what i asked.
andy:  were done. erin and i are over.
dwight:  so then you wont mind if tonight i just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. with sex.
andy:  have at it. or take it slow. whatever you guys work out.
dwight:   youre an idiot.
kevin:  kelly, that is mine! this is mine! 
erin:  uh-uh. uh-uh.
kevin:  no!
val:  oh ive got him!
darryl:  cannonball!  lets do this!
andy:   wow.
erin:  so i kind of stepped on this. i think its yours.
andy:  yeah. oh wow. how did you know it was mine?
erin:  the bernard family seal. duh.
andy:  duh.
erin:  sorry if your special night was ruined.
andy:  oh, whoa. whoa, no, its not a special night.
erin:  oh, you werent going to do that?
andy:  honestly erin, i dont know what im doing. i… i just… i dont know. thank you.
erin:  andys confused. thats not what i was hoping for, but its not so bad either. i can live with confused. i get confused. i totally get confused.
robert:  and of course, the pool. the ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. it was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.
jim:  to madness.
ryan:  to madness.
toby:  to madness. 
meredith:  to madness.
jim:  hey, um, i think you parked my car in. is there any way you can move your van?
meredith:  oh, im sorry. when i got here, i put my keys in a bowl.
jim:  are you serious?
ryan:  robert, i want you to know, im here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
gabe:  and that goes double for me. ill stay even later than youd like.
oscar:   toby! i am bacchus, god of wine!
toby:  and i am bacchuss friend!
robert:  gentlemen, bear witness. while ive been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. this is no get-together. this is a party. 
all:  yes! woohoo! bravo!
jim:  and theres my talking point.
robert:  yes, thats it. push yourselves, boys. its not a party if you dont do something that scares you. i need a breather. oh. oh. you two keep going.
ryan:  hey, hes asleep. we can just leave.
gabe:  so leave.
ryan:  two pools. a divider. a bridge. good choice. it says everything about everything, right robert?
kathy:  whats the water like?
darryl:  nice.
angela:  oh, it is warm.
phyllis:  roberts house is, well….i dont mean to sound offensive, but its like where a basketball player would live.
erin:  oh, dwight.
dwight:  uh huh.
erin:  that feels so good!
dwight:  yeah….baby.
erin:   hey, andy.
andy:  hey.
erin:  dwight gives the best back massages.
andy:  yeah, it sounds like it.
dwight:  hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
erin:  i dont know, why dont you check me dr. shrute. 
dwight:  no, seriously. your spine is jacked. its like the devils cursive.
erin:  you mean more like dangerous curves…
dwight:  youd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out…
erin:  ow!
erin:  you date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. its over. you start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. he says no. then he follows you home to make sure that you dont kiss somebody. then he ignores you at a pool party? am i right ladies?
dwight:   yeah. oh, yeah. oooooh, yeah.
jessica:  you guys ready?
andy:  bring it on guys.
dwight:  yeah…
andy:  lets go before i vomit. 
dwight:  ready?
erin:  im ready.
jessica:  whoo!
andy:  alright! here we go.
erin:  ok.
dwight:  rahhh!!!!!!!
jessica:  yeah, come on!
dwight:  get her! ruin her! 
andy:  hey! high-five!
jessica:  yeah!
jessica:  my brother and i were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. i mean, we beat the strauss twins. ok, i guess somebody didnt grow up in west hartford, connecticut.
robert:  this room i liked for the view. i dreamed that i would watch my guests walk to their cars at dawn, their faces flushed with the shame and regret for the choices they made the night before. 
ryan:  i get that.
gabe:  beautiful sentiment.
jim:  to the shame room! 
gabe:   i live in this room.
oscar:   oh, mineral-ey.
toby:  mineral-ey
