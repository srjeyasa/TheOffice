oscar:  oh, for gods sake. 
oscar:  planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. thats it. sometimes you get run over. welcome to the internet.
erin:  planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you dont.  and i dont.  but i am so excited to be a part of it.
andy:   after you my good sir.
dwight:  no, i insist.
andy:  i insist.
jim:  the search committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on robert california… for the manager position. who took one look around and left.  he drove down to florida and convinced joe to make him ceo… ceo… her own job. he talked her out of her own job. and i dont really know how someone does that. but, anyway, then the position was his to fill.   and he chose…
andy:   i… its unbelievable. true, i may have been the second choice, but i was the first-choices first choice. and, about dwight, i sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so i sat him down and we had a talk. and i told him, “i need a really strong number two. i want you to be my enforcer.” smart, right?
kelly:  (planking on top of cabinet] very smart.
andy:  uh, this has got to stop.
kelly:  i cant get down.
dwight:  k… kevin! 
dwight:  yeah, at first, i was really disappointed, but ive got a great daily routine going right now. i have upped my karate to eight times a week. ive added boxing – lunches and on weekends. i do kickboxing three times a week. krav maga four times a week. an hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. so yeah, im doin great.
dwight:  k, im gonna need some help. pam?
pam:  i dont think i should.
jim:  oh, yeah. pregnant.
pam:  right here. little michael scott- 
jim:  no, i told you i dont like that joke. it is a boy. we found out early.
pam:  much different the second time around. and i have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
angela:  look, its a ‘little pregs  and ‘big pregs 
pam:  wait, when did we start calling it that-
angela:  isnt it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
pam:  well, i am a few months ahead of you.
angela:  i am having a child with my husband, the senator. and pam is having a child with jim… the great salesman.
dwight:  hoist him aloft. cmon darryl. lift, lift darryl. 
darryl:  im lifting.
darryl:  yeah, i wanted the manager job, but i got somethin much better. this soda. this is mine.
stanley:  it might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
stanley:  i came up with a new thing this summer. i act like im telling someone how to do somethin. i go on with a long description and then i say, “and shove it up your butt.” its stupid, but its my thing now.
jim:  no one should be planking at all.
andy:  thank you, yes. dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?
dwight:  say no more.
dwight:   kids, dont try planking. its dangerous.  ‘specially with me around.
jim:  you watching that commercial again?  why do you keep watching it, if you know its just gonna make you cry?
pam:  because everything makes me cry, so whats the difference? this dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
jim:  hes got a bank vault. thats a start.
pam:  not enough though.
jim:  the new ceo works out of the conference room about half the time. but whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. and you never know who hes gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. you just hope its not you. and yet, you hope it is you too. its strange.
erin:  here we go.
robert:  hello.
erin:  robert california. lets have a conversation.
robert:  describe your day so far.
erin:  well, i woke up. and i hit the snooze-
robert:  and when you recount your day, never say you woke up. its a waste of your time. thats how every days begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man.
erin:  very smart, very smart. suddenly, i was awake. and ive been doing this thing-
andy:  hey, robert. we have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. i emailed you about it last night to confirm. and again this morning.
andy:  first item on the agenda: can i get everyone an extra long columbus day weekend. item number two, connect with the guy. robert california, what does he think of me? dont know, super care. number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.
erin:  pam, pam. psst. pam. 
pam:  jim. 
jim:   can i call you right back? thank you very much.  okay.  what is this?
andy:  the friday before columbus day. thoughts?
robert:  what are your thoughts.
andy:  just making chit-chat. kind of a medium year for womens soccer, no?
dwight:  what are you looking at?
jim:  its, its nothing.
dwight:  it cant be nothing.
phyllis:  yeah, it cant be nothing.
jim:   its just a list of our names, split into two columns.
stanley:  what?
jim:  okay, just wait one second, alright? i will copy it. do you have a pen?
erin:  no.
jim:  no. okay. um, ill take a photo of it. dwight, can you throw me my phone?
dwight:   nice catch.
pam:  if he comes out, distract him. 
kevin:  we need a warning signal.
jim:  we dont need a warning signal, kevin. we can see him right there-
kevin:  we do.
jim:  i promise you, we dont need a warning-
kevin:  warning! warning! warning! warning! warning!
phyllis:  ahhh! 
dwight:  phyllis! phyllis! you okay? you okay?
phyllis:  yeah. yeah. oh.
dwight:  … 2, 3! 
phyllis:  thanks guys.
dwight:  okay, which side of the list am i on?
jim:  left.
dwight:  yes!
jim:  why are you- how do you know?
andy:  really great list of names guys. thank you so much. good work.
jim:  uh, no, actually. that was in roberts notebook.
pam:  he left it at reception and we photocopied it.
andy:  oh, okay. i dont want any part of this.
pam:  maybe its a list of people hes gonna fire.
jim:  okay, its not that pam. you know, i was thinking it reminds me of those lists dwight used to make.
dwight:  this is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. this is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. heres something. who would eat who in an ‘alive situation. no… that cant be it.
andy:  i gotta say. kinda seems like the left sides the side to be on. me, jim, dwight, darryl. no offense pam.
jim:  i dont think its-
pam:  ‘scuse me?
dwight:  shhh, pam. cmon, dont be such a right-sider.
angela:  did you guys figure it out?
andy:  we couldnt crack it.
stanley:  go in there and just ask the man what it means.
andy:  hell know that we looked at his private notebook.
phyllis:  cmon, just say you saw the list by accident.
andy:  im already working on this columbus day thing for you guys and its starting to stack up. feels like a lot. one thing at a time.
phyllis:  yeah, thats all you had to do today was ask about columbus day?
robert:   yes, for gods sake andy. yes, come in.
andy:  whats up? weird thing. totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
robert:  great. thank you.
andy:  and it was open. and people saw this. and theyre just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
robert:  what is this?
andy:  its a photocopy from your notebook.
robert:  you read my notebook? and photocopied it. and distributed it.
andy:  no. they did. and they asked me to ask about it.
robert:  ah, please. heres what it is. its a doodle.
andy:  what?
robert:  some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. they draw houses, penises. funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. dont you think? well, i doodle too, but im not an artist. so i draw words and lists.
andy:  that is fascinating. and, by the way, i am so glad i asked. people were just sort of- did you just move my name?
robert:  might as well have been sketching a cube.
andy:  okay. roberts in the annex, everybody think quick. what do these groups have in common?
meredith:  maybe were sposed to do it with people in our group.
jim:  thats not it.
meredith:  people in the other group.
jim:  mmum, still wrong.
andy:  stanley, you do puzzles all day. whatdo we got?
stanley:  well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ‘em all up, and shove it up your butt!
andy:  thank you. a little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.
kevin:  i know! its alphabetical.
everyone:   no.
dwight:  no, its not. heres how we find out. lets line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. okay, left-siders over here. right-siders, line up over here. face each other. match it by height and relative weight. lets just size each other up here and left side of the list… attack!
jim:  wait, wait, wait! stop! stop! stop! will you stop?! 
andy:  dwight!
meredith:  hey!
kevin:  warning! warning! warning!
robert:   id like to invite the following people to join me for lunch: jim, dwight, angela, darryl, kevin, toby, phyllis, oscar.
dwight:  thats great. lets do this guys.
jim:  alright, well, i will see you in a bit.
pam:  i love you so much. 
jim:  hey. its nothing. alright? ill text you when we get there. let you know whats going on.
pam:  okay. 
jim:  nope. no dog video.
pam:  okay.
jim:  okay. see you guys.
andy:  well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. pizza partay! pizza! partay! pizza! partay!
robert:  jim, your daughter, cecilia. what does she think of the street?
jim:  uhhh, the street?
robert:  sesame street.
jim:  oh, i didnt know anybody called it- she likes it a lot- she, uh, loves elmo.
robert:  elmo, gods sake, its the elmo era.
jim:  right.
robert:  sesame street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. complete self-absorption of elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. ours is a cultural ghetto. wouldnt you agree.
jim:  yeah, she does like elmo.
oscar:  cultural ghetto? totally- totally agree.
phyllis:  completely.
darryl:  apt. apt analysis, robert.
kevin:  the thing that i like about elmo is the tickling.
toby:  i should not be here. im in the- i was in the wrong- im- im sorry. uh, just picture me back there. i- i was never here.
andy:  great group! pizza party!
kelly:  how is this a pizza party?
andy:  well, why dont you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
kelly:  yeah, well, thats just pizza. you need at least one other element for it to be a party.
andy:  okay. you guys ever had margarita pizza?
stanley:  whats that?
andy:  fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
stanley:  thats pizza.
pam:  thats regular pizza.
dwight:  you know, i feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question… what made you pick this group?
robert:  i just think you guys are winners and i wanted to have lunch with you.
dwight:  okay!
everyone:   awww.
phyllis:  well, what about the other guys.
dwight:  losers.
robert:  no.
dwight:  cmon.
robert:  i dont- i dont wanna say-
dwight:  cmon, cmon.
robert:  no, no.
dwight:  cmon.
robert:  ha, i guess i think theyre losers.
dwight:  ha ha, i knew it! ha ha! yes! woo!
robert:  probably shouldnt have said that. 
andy:  ah hah! their interpretation of margarita pizza. fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
pam:   oh, text from jim. “this is getting very weird. will explain later.”
pam:   oh, text from kevin.
meredith:  “suck it losers.”
ryan:  okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesnt the fact that im in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? oh! this crust is sharp!
pam:  i used to be young and cute and sorta funny and i could do those cute, little cartoons. and everyone who came through here was like, “whos that receptionist? i like her.” now im just a fat mom. yeah, and you take one look at me and youre like, “oh, loser.”
andy:  cmon pam. chins up, okay? bad joke. look around this room. does this look like a group of losers? seriously?
pam:  oh. oh god.
kelly:   oh. hey guys! we had so much fun. we had margarita pizza. we all hung out. got to know each other better. how was your lunch?
angela:  it was excellent.
darryl:  good times.
andy:  yeah?
dwight:  oh, we did. it was the best time. and you know what? now its over. back to work everyone. you too andy.
kevin:  i knew it. i just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. my parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. everyone.
jim:  well, that was certainly an odd lunch. is everything alright?
pam:  yeah, im fine.
kevin:   loser. losers. 
meredith:   just take the casserole out of the- take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. itll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
andy:  when i was a salesman i could just be like “not my job, not my prob. im going to the warehouse to polish my knob.” metaphorically, of course. but now, it is my job and my prob.
andy:  hi, robert? can you come out here please its really important. just wanted to clarify something. some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, lets say top-tier and others would be second-tier.
robert:  i never said that.
andy:  thank you. great.robert. i said winners and losers. is that what youre talking about?
andy:  oh, that, it might- that might actually be what im thinking of. can you clarify that?
robert:  let me tell you some things i find productive. positive reinforcement. negative reinforcement. honesty. ill tell you some things i find unproductive. constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. and then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. no, i do not believe in that at all. if i invited you to lunch, i think youre a winner. if i didnt, i dont. but i just met you all. life is long, opinions change. winners prove me right. losers, prove me wrong.
phyllis:  whew, well. i guess thats that.
andy:  no. no, no.
erin:  andy, dont go in there!
andy:  im going in there.
andy:  i know that every time i talk to you things just seem to get worse. but, you dont know these people and i do. and if i let you work with faulty information, well, then im not doing my job as regional manager. so, please take this pen and change your list.
robert:  im not gonna change my list, andy, and i dont use ballpoint pens.
andy:  well, then i will make a new list for you. stanley… you may think hes a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? and you may think hes hard to love, but did you know that hes in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?
robert:  i did not know about the sales figures.
andy:  meredith palmer… supplier relations. the word “no” not even in her vocabulary. and just to show you that im being fair. you had gabe in the loser column. i think that is astute. good call. pam, easily the most creative and kind person i have ever worked with.
dwight:  jim, shut the door. this is just gross.
jim:  shhh.
andy:  erin hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. a winner if there ever was one.
erin:  i like my new group. i liked my old group.
robert:  are we done?
andy:  yes. no! the friday before columbus day, were gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.
robert:  you want a three and half day weekend for columbus day?
andy:  yes, i do.
robert:  and you are aware that columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of native americans.
andy:  i dont care. 
andy:  hey guys. so columbus day, we got that half-day on friday.
stanley:  we get that every year.
andy:  well, you got it this year too.
phyllis:  good night, andy.
andy:  night.
angela:  bye.
oscar:  good night andy.
dwight:  good night.
andy:  night.
jim:  alright, im gonna go warm up the car.
pam:  okay. oh, uh, you dropped something. jim?
pam:  okay, i know ive been crying easily today, but-  i mean, thats just pretty killer, right? i mean, maybe its stupid. no.  its wonderful. im gonna frame it. i can always unframe it.
andy:  i gotta say, i think its kinda cool not knowing. its like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. did the butler do it? are they ghosts? you know? its kinda sophisticated.
kelly:  everybody hates those endings!
pam:   yeah, i hate those endings.
oscar:  i- 
kevin:  i was looking for patterns.
oscar:  i know.
ryan:  its all a mind game. he wanted us to see the list. hes a genius. you guys just dont get him.
creed:  i made a list like this for congress when i worked in hollywood in the 50s, theyre meaningless.
toby:  guys. really, its ok. everyone has made a really solid first impression, i dont think theres any reason for anybody to worry.
toby:  i am on the wrong side, and i am freaking out here
dwight:   man, its like hoisting a manatee. i cant get a grip its so vast.
jim:  ryan? a little help?
dwight:  god. how do whalers do it?
ryan:  heres the way trends move across the country. they start in japan. l.a. and new york get it soon after that. seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. chicago gets it three months later. then it travels down the mississippi, ok? all the red states start doing it. good morning america does a piece about it. and then, it shows up in scranton.
andy:  creed! wha-  this is a safety issue with you. theres no way to know if youre dead!
gabe:  good morning. 
gabe:  corporate wants me up here, dunder mifflin wants me down there. what they worked out is that monday, wednesday and friday im here in scranton, tuesday thursday im in tallahassee, i mean i feel like vera farmiga in up in the air, you know? more money more problems. although, i didnt get a raise, so you know. same money, more problems.
ryan:  its called owling. youll read about it in like eight months
jim:  uh, i will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.
robert:  that sounds good.
kevin:  chicken piccata, side salad.
darryl:  chicken piccata, salad on the side please.
oscar:  ill start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.
toby:  chicken piccata, side salad.
angela:  side salad, chicken piccata on the side.
phyllis:  ill start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
dwight:  steak. rare.
robert:  jim, you alright? what are you doing?
jim:  good. what? nothin
pam:  oh! text from jim. “this is…” hmm.
ryan:  profound man, your husband.
dwight:  one more. to our boss!
all:  hey!
jim:  i dont think we have to do this again cause its gonna take a whole. 
dwight:  you know what? let us treat you. what do you say? it has been such a pleasure.
robert:  i can expense it.
dwight:  i insist. it is gonna be our treat, please?
robert:  thank you.
waiter:  hi, mr. shrute. ive waited on you before. i just wanted to let you know that gratuity is not included in the bill and tips are expected.
dwight:  oh, tips are expected?
waiter:  yes sir.
dwight:  then expect to be shocked. jim, you owe me $14.75. oscar, $14.75. darryl….
gabe:  my entire childhood, i was the one left out, and i said to myself: gabe, if you just achieve some success, youll be part of them. youll be part of the happy ones. but instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.
meredith:  hey, this aint no breakfast club, bitch.
dwight:  whoo! yeah! yeah!
jim:  come on, man.
dwight:  winners
