david wallace:  …no, you lied to me andy. you pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
andy:  i resent that. i, i never lied to you.
david:  really?  “hey david, all is good in scranton pa.”
andy:  and all was good in scranton pa that day.
david:  “by the way, oscar says ‘hi”
andy:  oscar says “hi” all the time. he says all kinds of greetings. “hi” “hello” “hola” youre telling me youve never heard oscar say “hi”?
david:  andy.
andy:  but youre calling me a liar.
david:  andy!
andy:  by the way, that reminds me, i want to ask you about some of the lies youve been telling lately.
david:  watch it andy!
andy:  oh, here we go, january seventh 2013.  “hey andy, alls well. been meaning to make it down there but my wifes sick.” well, which is it?! is all well or is your wife sick?! busted!
david:  my wife?
andy:  this has been a really tough time.
david:  yeah?
andy:  yeah.
david:  has it?
andy:  erin just dumped me and i cant remember any of the aha moments i had on the boat, and i know it sounds weird to say but i really miss my beard.
david:  shh.
andy:  it was like a security blan-
david:  andy.
andy:  -ket
david:  shh. im not gonna fire you.
andy:  youre not?
david:  no.
andy:  thats awesome.
david:  i wouldnt own the company if it wasnt for you. so…i owe you that.
andy:  david, ill be there for you. these five words i swear to you. when you breathe, i want to be here for you. ill be there for you. thats a poem by j.b. jovi. i want you to have it.
david:  we are even…now. understand? got it?
andy:  crystal.
david:  you are on very- hey, very thin ice.
andy:  vanilla.  vanilla ice. it was a band.
andy:  good morning.
erin:  good morning.
andy:  and how are you on this fine- 
andy:   ok, we ready?  dont use that part. last week, erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. now i have to see her everyday at work. which is…brutal. when people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
andy:   ahhh! oooooh! ahh
pam:  he sounds like a wounded animal.
stanley:  shouldve put him out of his misery and just fired her.
phyllis:  i cant be around sad people, it makes me sad.
stanley:  im the same way with horny people.
pam:  ok. 
erin:  yes. pete and i have started seeing each other and andy still doesnt know. we thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. and hot for us. i mean i saw petes butt. its sick.
pam:   oh thats mine! um, ill just, ill get it out of the way for you.
pam:  jim set up a job interview for me today in philly. its um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because i live in a house and i know what a bathroom is.  im sorry, i am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than i expected. and, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
dwight:   no, dont just let her eat the grass, shell puke it right up. ok, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. im sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, mose, but shes your aunt too. fine. ill see what i can do.
dwight:   i need you.
angela:  ahh! dwight!
dwight:  and you should take breaks more often, ive been waiting there for 45 minutes.
angela:  what? what is it?
dwight:  its my aunt shirley, shes on her last legs.
angela:  dwight, thats awful.
dwight:  you have no idea. i mean her hair, clothes, its all falling off in great big clumps. and we need someone to go out there and clean her up. we had a nurse, but she quit because she was “poisoned” by aunt shirley.
angela:  what do you mean by “poisoned”?
dwight:  probably nothing, or strychnine. or lemonade and strychnine. which is actually what it was.
angela:  ok, well im very sorry about your aunt.
dwight:  thank you.
angela:  but i dont see how this is my problem.
dwight:  angela. you owe me one, remember? now please, shes an old woman angela. she needs a womans touch. its all hanging out-
angela:  ugh.
dwight:  and theres parts of her i dont even recognize.
angela:  gah.
dwight:  theres this one hanging part in particular, thats some sort of flap.
angela:  its fine.
dwight:  its like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
angela:  ugh! god, i cant. ok, ill-
dwight:  its a divet…
angela:  ill help you!
dwight:  ..where it was and it needs, it needs a…
angela:  ugh.
andy:  where are you going?
pam:  uh, not on a three month boat trip.
andy:  wha? oh, burn.  uh, excuse me. what, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
dwight:  how dare you?
andy:  im still the boss!
erin:  i…
andy:  the answer is yes.
erin:  ..just have some messages for you.
andy:  are they from you?
erin:  well no, theyre from clients.
andy:  well then, i dont want them. you can keep em. in fact, you can keep that big blue nautica sweater, i know how much you love it.
erin:  i cant. i-
andy:  nope, i insist upon it. its an awesome sweater. some great memories tied up in that thing.
erin:  these are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
andy:  i dont want to talk about work right now.
erin:  well i only want to talk about work right now.
andy:  then i want my big blue sweater back.
erin:  well, i gave it to the salvation army.
pete:  ive got the seat adjusted right.
clark:  perfect height, yeah.
andy:  she got rid of it. my blue sweater. what is that about?
pete:  i was just leaving.
andy:  stay! we are in the bro-zone layer. ok? nard dog, plop and clarker posey, aka clarkwork orange. heres the sitch: erin dumped me, natch. but she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. is she moving on a little fast, or am i being a total psycho? plop, you go first.
pete:  i dont know. women do tend to move on quicker than men.
andy:  survey says: enh! doesnt make me feel better at all. zero clark thirty, what do you got?
clark:  look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. i mean, youve got your freedom now.
andy:  last night i ordered a pizza by myself and i ate it over the sink like a rat.
clark:  there you go, good for you.
andy:  no.
clark:  you just let it all hang out, thats what…
andy:  may not seem like it, but this really helped. so, thank you. 
clark:  ill give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
dwight:  aunt shirley, hello! its me dwight.
shirley:  oh, lookie here. its big city dwight. careful you dont get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city dwight.
angela:  hello aunt shirley.

dwight:  you know what? before you put the new clothes on, angelas gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
angela:  yes. how would you like a nice warm bath?
shirley:  how would you like a mean cold slap? 
angela:  ow!

shirley:  i could do that.
dwight:  ok.
angela:  no. no.
dwight:  yeah, trust me.
angela:  no.
dwight:  it keeps her docile. go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
shirley:  step on it!
andy:  why doesnt erin seem sad? has she found someone new or something? and if so, why hasnt she told me? is she trying to spare my feelings? during breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
phyllis:  andy, dont. no good can come from snooping.
andy:  im not snooping, theres just some crud on her screen.
oscar:  youre clearly snooping.
creed:  thats kinda uncool, man.
meredith:  ah, come on.
phyllis:  andy!
oscar:  thats her private property.
meredith:  tell us!
andy:  uh, hello! whos snooping on who now?
phyllis:  what does that even mean?
meredith:  whats it say?
phyllis:  put it down.
andy:  everyone please, just-
creed:  its not cool.
phyllis:  put it down
oscar:  andy. that is her private property.
meredith:  boo.
andy:  oh my god.
stanley:  uh huh.
phyllis:  see?
stanley:  thats where noseyll get you.
phyllis:  told you so.
andy:  darryl, clark, toby, kevin, plop. take a knee. alright, you guys are gonna think im psycho again. uh, couldnt shake this feeling that erins dating someone so i looked at her phone.
darryl:  man, you cant do that stuff. youll only find pain. when my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
andy:  too late. i found out shes been texting a guy named pete. does anybody know a pete?
kevin:  pete…
clark:  hmm.
kevin:  pete what?
pete:  it just occurred to me that andy has been calling me plop for so long, he forgot my real name. which is pete.
pam:   hello!

pam:  bye.
angela:  gosh, she drank so much. and so quickly.
dwight:  in her prime, shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
shirley:  
dwight:  now all it takes is half a liter. shes dreaming. alright, lets get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.

andy:  no.
toby:  oh, andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of nellie. you cant just get rid of people over grudges.
andy:  nellie was a professional grudge. this is a purely personal grudge.
toby:  alright, well look. while i have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for pete &amp; erin.
andy:  they already have a contract?  “mutually agree to-” ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
toby:  its just boiler plating, you dont have to read it.
andy:  well, im not signing away my rights.
toby:  i already signed it. i was just showing you.
andy:  ok, well well see about that. 
toby:  andy, its not the original. and destroying it will not stop them from dating. andy.  its the original.

dwight:  yes maam.
angela:  good.
mark:  this is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. frankly, if i had my way, id toss the computers in the gar-bage. but unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. so. that aint gonna happen. hes a temp, dont worry about him. alice! alright, stay awake ok?
toby:  hey nellie. mmm. i am so sick of february. its the shortest month but it sure doesnt feel that way. we should catch up.
nellie:  um.

nellie:  oh no.
toby:  …feel like i may have glossed over a few…
nellie:  no no no no.
toby:  …minor points.
nellie:  no. toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this scranton strangler. do something about it. get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
toby:  ive been drafting a letter.
nellie:  for two years! then what? another year picking out a stamp? another six months before you decide to lick it? just- i dont want to hear it!
mark:  my aunt joan. oh, uh well, she uh, she worked here before i did, so theres no nepotism involved. in fact, to be honest with you im probably a little harder on her than i am on the rest of these people. ah, cute. not work on this…work on this months. ok nana? uh, when i say “chillax” people chillax. watch this. hey roger, chillax! must not have heard me.
roger:  no. i heard you.

pam:   oh my god.
andy:  thank you! thanks, thanks a lot. really appreciate it. you guys are supposed to have my back. ok? instead you let a guy named plop steal my girlfriend.
meredith:  hey boss, i did everything i could. i invited pete out for drinks, i emailed him shots of my junk….
andy:  ugh.
meredith:  kid doesnt have a romantic bone in his body.
phyllis:  come on andy, theyre a good match.
andy:  that doesnt matter. ok? what matters is that i am hurt! deep hurt inside of me. i dont care if theyre romeo and freaking juliet! i feel like the guy that juliet dated before romeo. probably her boss. and guess what? juliets boss also had feelings.
darryl:  hey, andy.
andy:  what?!
darryl:  youve got a booger bubble going on there.
andy:   sorry.
darryl:  its ok.
andy:  my whole life is a booger bubble!
mark:  this is a tiny resume. papa smurf! come back to the mushroom.  from the smurfs movie.
pam:  yeah, ive seen that with my kids. um, it is tiny, but ive actually been commissioned by the city of scranton to paint a mural-
mark:  what does this say here? to ti te per tat… what language is this? swahili? oh wait a second, now i can read it.
pam:  oh, cause it was upside down. 
mark:  youre a good audience. 
pam:  so um-
mark:  unlike some of these people around here.
pam:  yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
mark:  yeah, we dont have a lot of call for doodling around here. but i like this resume and heres why. it shows that you stick around. yeah. you dont jump ship easily. like a lot of these people. i mean they worship me you know? but do they like me? i mean…you think they like me, pam?
pam:  yes.
mark:   what if bob dylan was your boss? im gonna do dylan!  pam halpert is my name, and ive been at dunder mifflin for seven years? eight years? eight years, man. got the dunder mifflin blues. got the pam halpert blues. got the pra- went to the pratt institute…you have children?
pam:  two children, yes.
mark:  you wrote art and painting, kinda the same thing. kinda the same thing. sometimes i repeat myself, but thats just being pam. well im kinda cute and im- but im married so…leave that be.
pete:  hey. you got a sec to talk?
andy:  kinda painful to chat with you pete. ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. translation: penis. translation? my manhood.
pete:  yeah. look, uh i understand breakups are tough. you know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. but youve gotta move on.
andy:  great advice. thank you, you can leave now.
erin:  listen to him, andy. hes trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
andy:  awesome perspective. thanks for butting in.
pete:  well, ive been where you are now. i dated this girl alice and it was an ugly breakup. she worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. id run into her every day but i had to grow up and deal with it, and i did. were even facebook friends now.
erin:  see? we can all be friends!
pete:  yeah.
erin:  just, get over it. it doesnt have to be awkward.
pete:  i do think we can have a fair….
andy:  yeah, so life gives you lemons and youve just gotta eat them, rinds and all. and if you dont want to eat them? your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. so thats fun.
mark:  nothing to see here! boss at work. this will be your desk. right up front. best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. no pregnant women allowed. are you? uh, yeah i dont- not allowed to ask. so…
pam:  i am not pr-
mark:  youre not.
pam:  pregnant, no.
mark:  i didnt ask her if she was pregnant. she just offered it. the last three girls here all got pregnant.
pam:  wow.
mark:  dont be afraid, its a different chair. i dont want a guy up here. i want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. something that, i have to look out this window, i want someone-
pam:  im sorry i thought this job was for the position of office manager.
mark:  it is. yeah, you would uh manage this office. answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again.
pam:  so, kinda like a receptionist.
mark:  yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, its less demeaning. by the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? because i think this is pretty cool. pretty pretty cool. larry david, curb your enthusiasm. do you like that show?
pam:  yes.
mark:  well, i think they indulge themselves a little too much. i like scripted.
pam:  i spent 10 years as a receptionist, to michael scott. and i have kids now. and i just, i cant.
shirley:  ow! the braid is too tight.
angela:  oh hush. loose braids reflect a loose character. now stay still.

shirley:  ok.
angela:  there.
shirley:  thank you angela.
toby:  im going to the prison. this afternoon. im gonna talk to the strangler.

toby:  well i just wanted to say im doing it. 
nellie:  hes doing it.
pam:   hey!

andy:  wow this sure is intense. having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
pete:  andy, that is really inappropriate.
andy:  awkward.
pete:  it is awkward. this is a really uncomfortable situation that youve contrived.
andy:   really uncomfortable situation.
pete:  yeah.
andy:  its alright pete, you can handle it. i mean we all just gotta “move on”. aint that right professor lecture much? uh, question. hows that medicine taste? your own flavored? is it just me or have these tables turned? hmm. hmm. 
alice:  so theres no marketing department.
clark:  no.
pete:  no.
gabe:  you know, times were tough. i was unemployed, i was still heart-broken over you, ive lost a good fifty pounds. but as you can see i put all that weight right back on. feel how fat my buttocks are. yeah, its crazy. touch it. its like a warm pumpkin.
erin:  so andy just called you up out of the blue?
gabe:  yeah. he told me you two broke up.
erin:  yeah.
gabe:  you must be pretty horny. 
nellie:  well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. at least you know he is the strangler. the proof is in the grip. did they say when the vocal cords would heal?  one week?  ok, two weeks?  ok. you offered your neck in search of the truth. the proud neck of justice. isnt that the expression? no. well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. it really was quite brave.
shirley:  i feel like a show pony.
dwight:  and you look like one too. thank you angela.
angela:  youre welcome. would you like some stew?
dwight:  by all means. and i will carve the roast skunk. angela?

angela:  thank you. 
shirley:  so, whens the wedding?

angela:  no, dwight. the senator.
dwight:  leave him. he probably wont even notice that youre gone. be with me, monkey.
angela:  i cant be your monkey, dwight.
dwight:  im not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. we have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. the eighty or ninety years that i have left in this life…i want to spend with you.
angela:  i made a vow. i gave my word.
dwight:  stand by your man. its what i would want if you were mine.

andy:  thank you all for coming in. just wanted to check in. how is everyones day?
gabe:  honestly, it was a little weird.
andy:  really? hmm. thats interesting. because erin and pete thought it wouldnt be weird at all. why do you think it was weird, gabe? maybe because you and erin used to be an item?
gabe:  i still wear erins button-downs around the condo sometimes. so it feels to me like were still in a relationship-
erin:  gabe!
gabe:  …a lot of the time.
andy:  and alice, uh, i understand you once dumped pete, ouch.
pete:  dude, it was an amicable break up andy.
alice:  ok, while were rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem.
pete:  it was college. that is what you do.
alice:  yeah youre also supposed to go to classes, so theres that.
erin:  hey, andy, is this at all work related?
andy:  well get to that. gabe, did erin ever tell you that she loves you?
gabe:   oh no no no no no no. she wouldnt even let me say it. it was adorable. she would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
erin:  gabe, can you stop talking? cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
gabe:  i got a tattoo for you.
erin:  i didnt ask you to get that nike swoosh. nobody did! you did that for you!
gabe:  just do it. you were the it that i was just doing.
alice:  so youre dating a secretary now? moving up in the world, pete.
pete:  shes nice to me.
alice:  hows that p.e. degree coming? thats what he wanted to be. his dream in college was to be a gym teacher.
erin:  well, guess what? he could still be a gym teacher. in fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, lets-
gabe:  i technically cannot. i dont have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
pete:  oh my god.
gabe:  what kind of music are you into, peter?
pete:  uh, i like all kinds of music, gabe.
gabe:  really? all kinds? so you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the ku klux klan?
pete:  no!
gabe:  erin, are you even hearing this?
erin:  he didnt even say that.
alice:  he is not a very sophisticated man, i mean he cant even use chopsticks, so. do i need to say anything else?
gabe:  erin, ive been to japan. i know how to use chopsticks so well. come back. one night.
erin:  gabe, i dont-
gabe:  give me one night with you…
erin:  what is that supposed to mean?
gabe:  i have shaved everything…
erin:  i dont want you to shave everything.
alice:  i wasted two years of my life on you, you realize that right?!
pete:  i just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. 
gabe:  i am as smooth as a porpoise. {erin argues]
pete:  why dont you say in the beginning: “this isnt really going that well”
gabe:  shove his sashimi!
erin:  what do you-!
alice:  because i had to wait- 
andy:  alright, yes. that is a legitimate question. does making erin and pete feel bad make me feel better?  yeah. yeah, it does.
