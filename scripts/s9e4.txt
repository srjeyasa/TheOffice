jim:  last week, i finally told pam about the other job i took in philly…the side job. and she was so incredibly cool about it. and now i just wanna do something huge for her. like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and i was like wham!  gotta go through me first.
nellie:  andy, could i have a word please? um, it wont take a moment. its extremely important and it really has to happen now.
andy:  fine. i will give you one minute.
nellie:  oh, please dont use the hourglass.
andy:  you have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of its baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
nellie:  im trying to adopt a baby.
andy:  a baby what? a human?!
nellie:  and the…agency require a character reference from my employer.
andy:  oh.

nellie:  ..writing..
andy:  times up!
nellie:  fine.
andy:  sure.ill read her letter. and if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. ill sign that.
dwight:   “statistical correlations exist between emf radiation and various health hazards. but mainstream studies are inconclusive!” that means you cant make me do squat.
meredith:  you better fix this. i already ditched my uterus and i aint losing any more good parts.
dwight:  you people dont realize what youre asking. id have to rip open the walls.wed have to shut this place down for a week.
pam:  week off. thatd be great.
darryl:   hey, if you dont want to teach me power point, just say so.
clark:  i dont want to teach you power point.
darryl:  come on! just show me the power point.
clark:  just do the tutorial.
darryl:  youre the tutorial.
clark:  no, dude, im not. im not the tutorial.
darryl:  you could be.
clark:  mm-mm.
darryl:   what are you doing?
jim:  getting my wife a week off from work.
darryl:  you popped one kernel.
jim:  awesome, right? 
clark:  so creed is that dudes step dad?
darryl:  correct.
jim:  well, i dont know about the rest of you but im just gonna say it. im nervous. i have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. 
dwight:  what? come on.
creed:  im getting older. im losing my hair…
meredith:  im not gonna grow a third arm!
dwight:  i know what jim is trying to do. hes trying to get big bad dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky jimbo gets a paid vacation. well sorry, lucky jimbo, i can live very happily in a magnetic field. most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
jim:   “side effects of emf include: headaches…”
dwight:  had em all my life.
jim: ”..breast pain…”
dwight:  no nobbies, no probbies. nice try jim.
jim:  oof. “infertility.”
dwight:   yeah right. 
jim:  ah! theres my popcorn. can you just grab that for me?
dwight:  psh. keep your snacks on your side, jim. idiot.  what the?
jim:  what?
dwight:  some of these kernels have crowned.

pam:  oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
jim:  you mean lavernes pies tires fixed also?  yes we will be doing that. well be getting a dozen.
pam:  a dozen different pies? cause that means rhubarb.
jim:  why would you say that? i meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. i thought that was implied.
pam:  yeah, ok then.
andy:  ladies and gentlemen, i have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
dwight:  so, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.

pam:  whats this?
andy:  whoa!
jim:  what?
dwight:   bring it in!
dwight:  roll into the future with work bus. say goodbye to wasteful buildings. these days a mobile office isnt just for hotshot politicians. now anyone can rent a work bus.  if youve got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away.  in this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.

jim:  hey, dwight. i was trying to do something nice for pam.can you just, help me out? can we maybe take this thing somewhere? or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
dwight:  its not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.

andy:  alright! the fat people have spoken! dwight, get this bus moving.
erin:  yes! 
jim:  next stop: lavernes pies tires fixed also.

dwight:  get your foot behind the yellow line.
jim:  you got it.
erin:  yeah jim! 
darryl:   stop.

pam:  no, i mean hes sulking. thats not like him.
jim:  hes just mad that were all having fun.
pam:  then why isnt he scheming? or preparing to avenge?
jim:  hes fine. hes indestructible.
erin:  always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. were not hostages.
nellie:   well, i have considered kidnapping one.
erin:  never say that.
erin:  i am so excited thinking about this child youre going to adopt.
nellie:  i wish i could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. i would snap you up.
stanley:  next stop pies! 
group:  next stop pies!
kevin:  next stop pies!
jim:  lets go driver!  laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so…
kevin:  at five? thats only twenty minutes from now. the pie shop is thirteen miles away. so at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
angela:  so wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
kevin:  wh…
oscar:  hold on, kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
kevin:  314 pies.

jim:  ok, well i saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
dwight:  that name brand place? nope forget about it, sorry. the tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
jim:  are you kidding me? dwight, come on!
pam:  hey honey, i dont think we should push him.
jim:  oh no, im gonna push him. you know why? because youre getting a pie. why? cause you deserve it. and what is he doing? hes trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we wont get there. is that what we want?!
group:  no!

jim:  what do we want?!
group:  pies!
jim:  when do we want it?!
group:  pies!
dwight:  ok, fine. you win.jim, you win. we have been battling for a long time, but you know what? you win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go.  alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. go buy the whole world a pie.

meredith:  dwight, what the hell?
oscar:  dwight!
clark:  what?
kevin:  well now i dont even feel like pie. wait…no its back.

dwight:  im barren, jim.
jim:  what?
dwight:  my trouser hives are void of honey.i had congress with angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. i thought i would be a father and instead i am a eunuch. neutered by my own building.
jim:  is this about the popcorn? or the x on the ceiling? dwight, that was a prank.
dwight:  you mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
jim:  no.
dwight:  thats genius. thats the best prank youve ever done. 
jim:  ill take it.

nellie:  oh, why, is there something?
andy:  its inaccurate, dishonest and…in a word? dongwater.
nellie:  ah well, perhaps i could rewrite some of the-
andy:  heres the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? i did it. i read it. thank you very much to me for my time.good luck with your impossible dream.
nellie:  alright then.
jim:  dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
dwight:  really? how long did it take you and pam to conceive?
jim:  that doesnt matter.
dwight:  what position did you use to conceive?
jim:  ok…thats not…
dwight:  regular? or lady on her back? you used lady on her back, didnt you, you freak. yuck, gross. never mind, jim.
andy:   british women. famously overemotional. am i right?
pete:  i dont think thats nelly.
andy:  what?
nellie:  oh, oh no, no. look, its alright.  it really isnt your fault. no, no. look, its…you were so kind. and it isnt anything to do with you.
jim:  did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, were all kinda like your children?
dwight:  you know theres a phrase about that in german. bildenkinder. used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. but now? i really understand it.
jim:  well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
dwight:  bildenkinder.
jim:  ok. and theyre all dangerously close to not getting pie. and theres only one guy who can save them. its not me.
pam:  oh!  hey! howd it go?
jim:  its pretty good actually.
pam:  yeah?
jim:  we bonded. we got to- 
oscar:  whoa! whoa! dwight! 
dwight:  when you dont get out of the way! out of the way!
pam:  you feel ok now?
dwight:  oh, better than ok.  you know what honey? im gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
