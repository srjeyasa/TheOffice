oscar:  yesterday, angela may or may not have figured out that im having an affair with her husband. so i just have to wait and see. when she comes in, if shes cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, its business as usual.
oscar:  good morning. 
angela:  oscar…  can i ask you a question?
oscar:   of course, ask me a que–  questions.
angela:  is it cool in here to you?
oscar:   yes, a little bit.  yes.
angela:  i think the thermostat is acting up again.
oscar:  its the stupid thermostat! that thing is a catastrophe. so im gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. ill just go downstairs.
angela:  thank you.
oscar:  no, thank you, angela.
oscar:  she doesnt know. i shouldnt be surprised. this is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. basically, she has her head in the sand. in a way i feel sorry for her. i guess the universe rewards true love.
dwight:  well, well, well, its finally happened. pam has ceased caring.
pam:  these are my painting clothes.i think im gonna do it. i am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. 
meredith:  sure you dont want to put another coat of primer on that pam?queen of the primer, that one.
jim:  you got this, beesley. actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
pam:  are you avoiding your phone call?
jim:  what? yeah, right. as if.
jim:  today i will be asking david wallace if i can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that i started really needs me to be there.
pam:  last week jim wasnt there, and they named the company athlead.
jim:  i could have prevented that. so i have to talk to wallace.
pam:  tell them your opening line.
jim:   hey david, how would you like a guy whos not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in philadelphia?
pam:  i think its good. he likes fishing.
jim:  this is gonna be awful.
pete:  one of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. and when theyre in, i fill out one of these cards. but the informations already on the computer, so….why am i filling out the card? i asked andy, and he told me to “chillax,” and then went away on a big, long boat ride. so here we are. dont give me a pointless office chore, because i will build a little paper house.  fight the power.
angela:  meet me in the old place, five minutes. i need you.
angela:   ugh!
dwight:  come on in, the waters fine.
angela:  dwight, its not that kind of meeting. put your clothes back on.
dwight:  i know. thats not why im naked. i always work out without my clothes. 
angela:  just put them on! put on your clothes. i need your help. i need someone who can operate outside of the law. ugh.
dwight:  oh, im sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. if im not in your panties, i dont go vigilantes. why dont you ask your husband?
angela:  my marriage is in danger. i dont know who i can trust. i need someone to be there for me.
dwight:   all right, what are we talking? surveillance, wire-tapping?
angela:   something like that.
dwight:  yeah, the less i know, the better. i know just the guy. he was a volunteer sheriff too. kicked off the force.
angela:  can you arrange a meeting?
dwight:  i can try. im gonna use sms text.
angela:  okay.
dwight:  text went through.
angela:  okay.
dwight:  all we can do is sit and wait.
angela:  okay.
dwight:   oh, look at that. yeah, hes free anytime. not a problem.
jim:  i mean, i can handle any client issues from philly.
david:   yeah, but i really need someone in the office. if theres a crisis — the more i think about it —
jim:  oh, you mean handle it in person. oh, well, phyllis and stanley have agree to cover for me while im gone.
david:  they did?
jim:  yep.
david:  oh, okay. well, that is different. in that case, yes– maybe this can work.
jim:  oh, great.
stanley:  why should we help you?
jim:  because were friends.
stanley:  when is my birthday?
jim:  unfair. whens my birthday?
stanley:  i dont know, because were not friends.
jim:  how about this– you let me take you to lunch, and i make my case?
stanley:  now were talkin.
jim:  all right.
phyllis:  yeah.
kevin:  make it go taller.
pete:  thats the idea.
kevin:  no, not taller this way, taller this way. 
pete:  well, ive gotta build a wider base first before i can go higher.
kevin:  youre not getting this, peter.  make it go wider… up!
pete:  will do.
darryl:   what are yall doing?
kevin:  me and pete are building a tower.
darryl:  cool. it should be taller though, right?
kevin:  obviously. hes a sweet kid, darryl. but hes not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
pete:  kevin, i can hear you.
kevin:  huh?
angela:  ow! dwight! ow!
dwight:  get in the van.
angela:  god!
trevor:  is it safe to talk?
dwight:  well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but i dont see them so i think were good.
angela:  so what are your credentials?
trevor:  i started following people around to get exercise. turns out, im damn good at it.
angela:  do you have a gun?
dwight:   does he own a gun? show her.
trevor:  you tell me.
angela:  what is this?
trevor:  its the receipt for my gun.
angela:  you dont carry it with you?
trevor:  read the receipt. thats a $300 gun. someone could steal it.
dwight:  do you have any idea how many guns trevors had stolen from him?
trevor:  now i keep it in a safe.
dwight:  mm-hmm. good safe?
trevor:  oh, you tell me. 
dwight:  wow!
pam:   i guess if i make a mistake, i can just paint over it with a shrub or something. its just, i think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. so, im gonna limit myself to one shrub.
hide:  you paint wall now?
pam:  yeah. painting now. i just want to make sure that…
hide:  you paint now.
pam:  its probably gonna be a few minutes. so you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
hide:  i wait.
meredith:  sweet.
erin:  yay!
darryl:  thats what im talkin about.
pete:  this next card comes to us thanks to meredith palmer, who called eastern pennsylvania seminary a, quote ‘sausage factory.
meredith:  oh oooh!
everyone:  
meredith:  boom!
darryl:  bang.
kevin:  yep, yep, yep.
pete:  all right. up next we got a whole lotta creed.
creed:  lets find out what i did.
pete:  all right.
dwight:  you get half now and half upon completion of said job.
trevor:  and thats all off the books?
angela:  obviously.
trevor:  nice. no taxes.
angela:  okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
trevor:  so whats the job?
angela:  murder.
trevor:  okay, thats the big one. thats the big “m.”
dwight:  you cant have someone murdered.
angela:  what if they deserved it?
dwight:  what did they do to you, angela?
angela:  theyre sleeping with my husband.
dwight:  oh, monkey. oh, i feel for you.
trevor:  this seems a little crazy.
dwight:  yes. crazy. thank you.
trevor:  but i think im up for it.
dwight:  no! no!
angela:  thank you.
dwight:  absolutely not. there are a lot of different ways to get revenge. ive had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch–
trevor:  thats very effective. ive been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. its devastating.
angela:  no, no, no. it has to be physical. i want this person to suffer.
trevor:  what about a knee-capping?
dwight:  no! youre not helping, trevor!
angela:  yes, a knee-capping could work.
dwight:  no. angela! what are you saying?
angela:  you said you would be there for me.
dwight:  im trying, but what youre asking is–
angela:  its the only thing that will make this right.
dwight:  okay. but its cruel, because a woman with damaged knees cant scrub worth a damn.
trevor:  all right, then its settled. one knee-capping. now, the hit goes down at 4:00. keep in mind, once i leave, theres no turning back.
jim:  you know, truth be told, i think all youll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while im gone.
stanley:  weve got all afternoon to talk about that.
waiter:  morning, folks.
stanley:  ill have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
waiter:  actually, the surf and turf does come with lob–
stanley:  not enough lobster. side order.
phyllis:  how much wine do you have?
oscar:  i brought you a cookie.
angela:  oh, thanks, oscar. youre such an angel.
oscar:   i just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so… yeah, were good. yeah.  we dodged a bullet, yes. okay. yeah. yeah, yeah– well, i gotta go now, but– okay, bye. bye.
pete:  there we go.
everyone:  
pete:  nicely done. very nicely done. all right, this next one goes to darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex.
nellie:  oooohh… you salty dog.
darryl:  well, yeah, what can i say, a players gotta play.
pete:  there you go.
darryl:  actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. but im gonna let them think the other thing.
kevin:  okay, i got this one.
nellie:  oh, be careful! be careful! be careful
kevin:  no, i got it. easy does it, everyone. nobody even take a breath.
everyone:   oh no! kevin!
nellie:  what did i just say? what did i just say?
pete:  hey, hey, hey, its just a mistake. just a mistake. thats what this towers all about —  mistakes. okay, if youre afraid of screwing up, the towers not for you. show of hands — who here has never had a complaint? thats right. nobody. see that? nobody. okay? lets get back to work, huh? come on, you in?
kevin:  yeah.
pete:  there we go. all right, lets do it.
jim:  you know, at the end of the day, its really only two days. i mean, ill be back in the office.  if you need me for an emergency, call me.  ill be there…
phyllis:  you know what? i dont know where the years went.  ‘cause sometimes when i look at my hands, i dont even recognize them.
jim:  tell me about it.
phyllis:  whose hands are these?  theyre not my hands. i dont know.
jim:  all right. you know what?  maybe well just… well go slow.
phyllis:  no. jim… 
pete:  all right. check it out.
everyone:  
pete:  like a phoenix from the ashes. ksshhhh!
kevin:  nice.  pretty soon, were gonna be at the ceiling.
erin:  whoo!
pete:  can you hand me a card?
erin:  um,. its empty.
pete:  what?
nellie:  oh, come on. we could use a blank card.
everyone:  no!!
meredith:  thats cheating.
pam:  i could get us a complaint.
meredith:  you? little miss priss? you wouldnt fart on a butterfly.
pam:  no, i wouldnt. i cant even relate to that impulse. but i bet i could get us a customer complaint. id like to try.
nellie:  hmm. yeah.  all right! yea, go, pam! pam…
everyone:   “pam!”
angela:  what? why did you call me out here?
dwight:  the target– its oscar, isnt it? he and the senator are gaying each other.
angela:  i dont know what youre talking about.
dwight:  your nostrils tell a different story. they flare like that every time youre engaging in deception. hello again, naughty nostrils.
angela:  fine! its oscar. so what?
dwight:  well i could understand you wanting to get a strangers knees whacked. but a co-worker– dare i say, a friend?
angela:  exactly, a friend. someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
dwight:  i cant even imagine how painful this must be for you. but the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
angela:  well, you might be right. but its too late now.
dwight:  what do you mean?
angela:  hes here.
dwight:  no! no, no! 
dwight:  oscar? oscar. oscar, good. hey come with me.
oscar:  what?
dwight:  come — come with me.
oscar:  what are you doing?
dwight:  there are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. you have got to see this. theyre extraordinary.
meredith:  yahtzee.
trevor:  sandwich delivery for mr. oscar martinez.
kevin:  i am oscar martinez.
angela:  no, not him, not him. outside. outside.
kevin:  wha– wh–
angela:  you know, theres doughnuts in the break room.
kevin:  nice! yeah.
jim:  listen, i was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
stanley:  dont be pushy jim. its tacky.
jim:  all right. phyllis! phyllis, thats– thats decorative.
phyllis:  no, theres wine in here.
jim:  still decorative.
stanley:  is it white wine?
jim:  no.
phyllis:   can you help me?
jim:  dont– dont– dont pole people with knives.
phyllis:   ha ha!
jim:  phyllis!  wow.
stanley:  ooh, bring it over.
phyllis:  got it.
dwight:  theres no time to explain.  okay, actually, there is time to explain. when angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
oscar:  oh, my god! what is wrong wiht you?
dwight:  what is wrong with you? there are a million gorgeous guys in the scranton wilkes-barre area, and you choose the man whos the father of her child?
oscar:  i dont know what youre talking about.
dwight:  oh, dont lie. im trying to save those precious knees youre always bragging about.  now, lets get out of here. he could be right behind us.
dwight:  aah! actually, hes right in front of us.
trevor:  lets get it on. im gonna do this. i might– i might puke, but im gonna do this.
dwight:  no, trevor, i am not gonna let you. hes a dunder-mifflin man. hes my tribe.
trevor:  im sorry, dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, im gonna follow through on something, all right? i have masculinity issues– stop! no!
oscar:  i got it.
dwight:  disarm!
trevor:  you dont–

trevor:  okay, okay, okay, okay.
dwight:  no! no, oscar. hes a friend. hes a friend.
erin:  okay, the client is heymont brake and tire. theyre family-owned, but dont let that take away from your edge!
nellie:  come on, pam, i know you can fail. i see failure in you.
creed:  remember, youre a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. like this.
pam:   hello, this is pam halpert. im calling from dunder-mifflin. yes, your paper provider. and i just called to say… your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, “hey, kool-aid.” yeah, your mamas fat. this is pam halpert.

oscar:  what the hell, dwight?
dwight:  see ya later, trevor.
oscar:  you are incorrigible!
dwight:  i just saved your life. youre welcome!
oscar:  you hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
angela:  you deserved every bit of it!  you made my husband gay.
oscar:  what– what i did was wrong, and i have to live with that every day. but your husband is… gay. he was gay when you married him!
angela:  no. no.
oscar:  angela, until you face that, youre gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. but if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead — i wont stop you. hit me. you have my blessing. hit me.
angela:  well are you gonna let go of it? because part of the blame is definitely on you.
oscar:  angela, its a lead freaking pipe.
angela:  god! 
oscar:  aah!
angela:  you were supposed to be my friend.
oscar:  im so sorry. angela–
dwight:  oscar.
pete:  our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to pamela halpert…
everyone:  
pete:  for insulting a clients recently deceased mother.
nellie:  yes!
pam:  i did not know that.
pete:  well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.

jim:  shuckin the peas.  you should go back to the first part, though. you are  gonna  cover for me?
stanley:  yeah.
phyllis:  of course we are, jimmy. we love you guys.
jim:  oh, my god, thank you.  thank you.
pam:  if youre an artist, you have to be okay with the idea  that you cant please everybody all the time.
hide:  you paint very bad–
pam:  shut up, hide!  i mean, do you think kevin cares what people think about him– or creed or meredith? oh my gosh, these are my role models now. you know what? im okay with that.
dwight:  where does gayness come from? and how is it transmitted?
toby:  that is– that is a loaded question.
angela:  my pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
toby:  he said that?
angela:  well, he didnt fight me hard on it.
toby:  i– i dont know if theres truth to– to, uh, to that.
angela:  what is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
toby:  oh… uh…
angela:  is it called red-vining?
dwight:  is it called red-vining?
toby:  i dont…
dwight:  we heard it was called red-vining.
angela:  people red vine.
dwight:  where are gay mens vaginas?
toby:  they dont have vaginas.

toby:  uh… wow….
