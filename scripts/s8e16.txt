pam:  hey angela, you wanna see a picture of phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
angela:  so cute.
oscar:  hey, you guys want to see a picture of gerald wearing galoshes? he refused to go out in the rain until i bought these. now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
pam:  oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
angela:  news flash – if you didnt carry it around for nine months, it isnt your kid.
pam:  exactly. unless you adopted, of course.
angela:  that is where we disagree.
oscar:  hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
pam:  no, three-month-old humans dont do that.
angela:  my phillip is crawling.
pam:  angela is such a liar!
oscar:  its maddening!
oscar:  exactly. thats just like crate training. all night long, all night long.
pam:  well count yourself lucky. wait until you have two. thats two sleep schedules, two naps that dont coincide, i mean, youll never sleep again.
angela:  no one said “you must have two”
oscar:  like her genes are so important. the world just needs more pam/jim dna. thank you, no.
angela:  no thank you.
andy:   check this out. my brother just got a new sailboat. he has no idea what he just got himself into. theres nothing harder than taking care of a boat…am i right?

nellie:  i cant be hypnotized, dwight. i tried it, i ended up smoking more.
dwight:  can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? free them up to focus more completely on the menial. like stacking or sorting, or-
jim:  catching butterflies.

jim:  theater.
dwight:  waste of time.
jim:  dragging.
dwight:  thats just a verb.
jim:  dragging sticks.

nellie:  alright, im gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? just… you three, no.
packer:  not good enough (clicks tongue)
dwight:  english peoples main use today is judging american talent.  youre crap. youre wonderful.  theyre mean, but theyre incisive.

andy:  tonight were staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the florida trip.
pam:  yes, of course, we couldve just been doing this the whole time, but someone dropped the ball.
andy:  …ball droppings can be beautiful. for example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
packer:  jason bourne would kick bonds ass.
nellie:  jason bourne has no support staff. his own governments out to get him.
dwight:  genghis khan could take em both down cause hes not afraid to kill children … what? its true. he- he would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (jim taps dwight on the shoulder)
packer:  okay, drinking game. count of three, take three sips.
dwight:  thats a stupid game. i got a great drinking game. okay, everyone empty your pockets. whoever has the most seeds is the king. whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
gabe:  what happens if youre the hunchback?
dwight:  oh, you get kicked.
jim:  how many buttons do you have?
dwight:  (takes out bag) 40. always.
cathy:  can i see?
dwight:  sure. (hands bag to cathy)
cathy:  so, i get to kick you now.

darryl:  “youre such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.”
kelly:  five dots, darryl, are you kidding me? okay, cause three dots means ‘to be continued, four dots is a typo, but five dots means “whoa, do not make me say what i want to say, baby, but if i did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
everyone:  oh…

nellie:  you look like ed harris if they stretched him a little bit.
dwight:  you wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree?  …ahhmmm… excuse me… what?! not now, im busy.
jim:   im sorry, i thought youd want to know that i saw a bedbug in my room. but, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
dwight:  wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? oh no… freak, i need a favor.
gabe:  well, then you have to call me by my name. gabriel susan lewis.
dwight:  i gotta be gone for a few minutes. you make sure that packer does not sleep with nellie.
gabe:  whats in it for gsl?
dwight:  you really want packer as your boss?
gabe:  got it.
dwight:  if jim has bedbugs, that means theyre everywhere. i cant risk them coming back to schrute farms. our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
dwight:  where did you see it?
jim:  in the bed.
cathy:  i havent seen anything.
dwight:  we gotta find it before it eggs. 
cathy:  jeez…
dwight:  describe it.
jim:  brown, shiny, painful bite.
dwight:  could be a bat weevil… describe its mood. did it seen sleepy?
jim:  stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
dwight:  fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
jim:  so smug. like he thought it was funny, like this.
dwight:  pshh. thats a bedbug.
jim:  yeah.
dwight:  everythings a joke.
jim:  i know.
dwight:  check your hair! 
jim:  ow.
dwight:  god, oh. so greasy, you should just shave all this.
jim:  just check it.
dwight:  you are clean. okay… one thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide  i am going to generate myself into a human trap.  when i jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. and then well see whos laughing. 
jim:  alright.
dwight:  yeah.  cover me!
cathy:  is this really nessecary?
jim:  he knows what hes doing.
dwight:  let the bedbugs bite!
cathy:  ugh, god, i feel so gross. i have to go take a shower.
jim:  alright, then i will catch you later… what do we do now?
dwight:  we wait.  come to papa.
jim:  oh.
jim:  i dont know, dwight, i think maybe you should check again.
dwight:  nope, i wasnt bitten.
jim:  well, maybe it isnt warm enough in here.
dwight:  oh, its plenty warm, and i was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
jim:  come on.
dwight:  if there were any in here, they wouldve imbedded themselves in me.
jim:  you know what? maybe they just ate.
dwight:  no, youre good. clean bill of health! besides i gotta get back downstairs. i left packer alone with nellie for way too long.
jim:  okay, theyre fine. theyre adults.
dwight:  no, thats the problem. packer is trying to bed nellie for the vp job unless i do it first.
jim:  is that really how you want to get this job?
dwight:  such a chorus girl.
jim:  okay, dwight… dwight… dwight, dwight dwight!… uh…
cathy:   is crazy gone?
nellie:  oh!
gabe:  they dont make these cords in boot cut anymore!
dwight:  euughh… pathetic, huh? a real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present… hey.
cathy:  yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster… okay, cool. thanks… i know, im a pig, right?
jim:  hmm? no.
cathy:   wait, this why i exercise like a fiend. feel. seriously.
jim:  okay alright.  im really sorry, uh, i just have to say it. im-im married. im very happily married.
cathy:  oh my god, what are you thinking?
jim:  um… i mean-
cathy:  i know that youre married, i sat at your wifes desk. how little do you think of me?
jim:  im sorry, i feel like maybe im-im i misread things. okay, lets just go back to watching.
cathy:  can you… without running to the other side of the room all night?
jim:  yes, i can.  uh, all right. im really sorry. i think well just… well just watch. you can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. take another shower, i dont care.
cathy:  okay.  i am so cold.
jim:  
pam:  hey, darryl. you okay?
darryl:  shes got a boyfriend.
andy:  play it cool, man. shell come around.
pam:  no, you should go for it. i mean nothing wouldve happened with me and jim if he didnt put himself out there.
andy:  yeah, but… my friend jim would tell you to play it cool.
pam:  my husband would tell you to go for it.
ryan:  hey.
erin:  hey.
ryan:  hey.
erin:  hey.
ryan:  hey, this is fun.
erin:  a lot of fun.
ryan:  i know. can i give you a compliment? im really impressed by how much youve grown. since i met you, its like night and day.
erin:  you should move down here with me.
ryan:  yeah?
erin:  we could be roommates.
ryan:  really?
erin:  we could get a dog. we could go to r-rated movies. and who knows, i mean, youre a guy, im a girl-
ryan:  yeah.
erin:  maybe in six months-
ryan:   six months?… um, okay, im in love with kelly.
nellie:  put your forehead near mine,and see if you can read my thoughts.
dwight:  okay… seven, one, one, nine…
nellie:  no, no, no, not numbers, no.
dwight:  no, okay.
nellie:  no.
dwight:  try again… ugh, im still getting numbers! seven, one, one… is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? ‘cause please stop, okay?
nellie:  dwight, give me a key card to your room. meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
dwight:  wait, the numbers!
nellie:  mm-hmm.
dwight:  oh…
nellie:  mm-hmm…
dwight:  there you go.
nellie:  i will see you in seven-
dwight:  seven minutes. … nellie, wait. let me write my room number on the card. . 
dwight:   win at all costs, dont respect women. these are the tenets i was brought up with, and they have served me well. but my ancestors never worked in corporate america, and before that, hunters. and before that, time travelers. and before that, me again. at least, thats how the legend goes. the point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. they just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
angela:  1434-967, paid.
darryl:  it has been processed.
val:  it has been delivered.
pam:  thats it, last one.
kelly:  andy this has been an amazing night. epic.
andy:  cool-down fiesta begins right now. i got decaf coffee…
phyllis:  no way.
andy:  i got romy and micheles high school reunion…
val:  hey. i just wanted to apologize. i mean, that was so weird. can we just, like, never talk about it again?
darryl:  sure.
val:  okay, thanks.
darryl:  hey, just so you know, me and you… i dont think thats ridiculous… dot, dot, dot… dot, dot.
jim:  all right. now i think its time for you to go.
cathy:  what? oh, jim, i thought we talked about this. youre cool, right?
jim:  cathy, go.
dwight:   wheres the bug?
jim:  awesome.
dwight:   stand back!
cathy:  aah! stop, it, oh my god! that burns! what is that?!
dwight:   its a compound of chemicals i pulled off the maids cart!
cathy:  
jim:  right there! 
cathy:  oh stop it, stop it, stop it!
jim:   oh, big one! big one! really big one!
cathy:  i cant breathe!
dwight:  i think i saw it!
cathy:  stop it! 
jim:  nice job, i think you got em.
dwight:  you cant stay here, this place is a biohazard. if i were you, id just bunk with cathy.
jim:

jim:  oh yeah? whats the first best?
nellie:   dwight?  hello? dwight?
jim:   is that nellie?
dwight:   dont let-shh!
nellie:  are you in there? i can see the light on under your door. hello?   oh, look at that. the light went off, just as i said the light went on. hello?  dwight?  dwight.
