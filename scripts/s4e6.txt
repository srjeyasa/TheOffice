rolando:   dunder mifflin, this is rolando.oh yes, shes been expecting your call.
karen:  yeah
rolando:  karen?hes on line one
karen:  thanks ro.hey, we finally connected.hows scranton
karen:  i am the regional manager of dunder-mifflin utica branch.turns out its a pretty easy gig when your boss isnt an idiot and your boyfriends not in love with somebody else
karen:  look, all im saying is it would be a great opportunity, and wed love to have you come aboard.so think about it, okay?okay, bye
karen:  look, for the record, a certain scranton salesman approached me, okay
michael:  this is perfect
dwight:  he looks like your twin
michael:  this is a dummy, a la ferris buellers day off.we have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.when somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.now nobody knows whether i am here, or whether i am gone
dwight:  i will know
michael:  but, you will not tell anyone
dwight:  i wont need to because well be together playing hooky.yeah
michael:  well, sometimes.most of the time i will be with ryan, or darryl.yes?oh good, good stanley!first victim, this is what i want you to do.go out, come back in.were going to hide.i want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay
stanley:  i dont understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here
michael:  just go out, and come back in
stanley:  i got an offer from utica for more money, and im going to take it
michael:  what
michael:  hey everyone, can i have your attention please?i just thought you all should know that stanley hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend karen from utica is going to give him more money to work there
all: 
michael:  no, no, no, no, no-no, no no.you completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.clearly, karen is trying to get back at us because jim dumped her
jim:  oh, i dont think that is whats happening
michael:  okay, smarty pants, then why?why is she trying to take stanley from us
stanley:  i think its because of my sales record
michael:  that could not possibly be it
michael:  you cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.the bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.i dont know how george bush did it when colin powell left, and if utica thinks that they are going to poach stanley, they have another thing coming
michael:  how can i get you to stay
stanley:  money
michael:  yeah we all want money.but there is none in the budget, so… tell me why youre really leaving
stanley:  money
michael:  mo money mo problems, stanley.you of all people should know that.let me ask you this, if i were
stanley:  money
michael:  pssh, kay
pam:  oscar, did you bring it
oscar:  to be edwardian.his best work
pam:  okay, well i have the tablecloth, dont forget the flatware
oscar:  sure thing pam, cant wait
pam:  oscar, toby, and i are founding members of the finer things club.we meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.sometimes the debate can get heated, but were always respectful.there is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.its very exclusive
oscar:  besides having sex with men, i would say that the finer things club is the gayest thing about me
jim:  so tell me again why i cant be part of your club
pam:  because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny
jim:  oscar
pam:  some people
karen:   hello
michael:  fillipellers, hows it hanging
karen:  michael
michael:  to the left
karen:  listen, i
michael: to the right
karen:  im
michael:  okay, enough small talk, go ahead
karen:  you called me
michael:  yes, listen, um…you cannot tear stanley from his family like this
karen:  im pretty sure his familys coming with him
michael:  no, his work family.look, this is very hard for me, but im going to give you my best man.you may have toby
karen:  tobys not a salesperson
michael:  you can train him.hes very very smart, and funny, and charming… you know, i cant do it, toby is the worst.that- that was a bluff, um…listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, im going to poach one of yours
karen:  oooh.good-bye michael
michael:  okay, good-bye.wait!wait! karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?your best one
pam:  i have ben nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in utica
michael:  hi ben, michael scott
ben:  hi michael
michael:  im going to cut right to the chase here.do you like magic?because im a genie in a bottle, and im going to grant you three wishes.to move to scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend
ben:  arent you the guy that hit the woman with your car
pam: 
michael:   get out.  uh, yeah.i also saved her life, but i guess thats not as grabby
ben:  everyone says scranton branch is worse than camden.didnt everyone from stanford quit, like immediately
michael:  no, i fired them, and your next. … so what do you say
ben:  seriously
michael:  what is that guy talking about?scranton is not lame.scranton is the cool, fun branch.were like animal house
dwight:  found him
michael:  jim, were getting crapped on.word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it
jim:  so what are you going to do
michael:  what are we going to do?we are going to make a monster sale, thats what were going to do.corcroan dropped staples
jim:  did they
michael:  yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.you, me, dwight are going to jump into my pt cruiser, and were going to crush this sale.were going to prove, what the hell is that music
pam:  its vivaldi, for finer things

dwight:  oh no, that is too bad.shoot
jim:  okay
michael:  hey dwight, he found it
jim:  you know what?im just going to call a cab from here
michael:  alright, youre going to miss the best prank ever
jim:  alright.wait, what are you planning on doing
michael:  do you really wanna know
jim:  oh, god.
michael:  follow me, come here.heres what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.i brought silly string, dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs
dwight:  or real bombs

dwight:  yeah, come on, it will be so badass
michael:  uh, maybe, maybe, i dont know
jim:  no
michael:  it could be badass.yeah, it will
jim:  no, no absolutely we are not doing this
dwight:  come on, i already filled the bottles with the gas, its going to be so badass
jim:  are you kidding me?weve been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time
michael:  teach her to offer stanley more money
jim:  so the deal was, dwight doesnt blow anything up, and i wear a costume.and a moustache
michael:  so, why did you and karen break up?was it the sex
jim:  what
michael:  i cant imagine the sex being bad, i mean her body is
jim:  okay, you know what

jim:  michael, watch the road
dwight:  hey, youre making me spray
michael:  ill kill you man
jim:  michael! michael, pull over
michael:  that is just so disgusting
jim:  pull over, pull over
dwight:  i think i cut my penis on the lid

toby:  i know right?i just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the adriatic
pam:  and spend time with george emerson.thats what i would do.i mean its the best male protagonist weve read, right

dwight:  lets move! move, move, move, move
jim:  shut up, you, shut up!this is the dumbest thing weve ever done
pam:  i think its interesting how forster uses italy to represent sexuality and passion.  and that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence.and lucys torn between these two things.shes torn between passion and convention
kevin:  damn it
pam:  it just- to be making a case for passion in edwardian times, i thought was, uh
oscar:  yes
kevin:  damn it!
pam:  maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer
oscar:  very brave.
pam:  very brave choice also, i thought
oscar:  and george, his- his youthfulness.his, um, freedom. evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um…what are you microwaving!

jim:  isnt that thing huge
michael:  its enormous, but its got wheels.were wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.get the car ready, keep the engine running

jim:  you good?im just checking on the other branches.michael wants me to do that from time to time, so
dwight:  do not tell karen about the industrial copier
jim:  copy that
karen:  i cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a pt cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good
karen:  let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted
dwight:  listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people
karen:  im taking stanley
dwight:  then we will burn utica to the ground
michael:   dwight.granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.and if you so much as harm a hair on stanleys head, we will burn utica to the ground.
karen:  jim, hang on a second
jim:  yes
karen:  so youre still doing this kind of stuff, huh
jim:  yeah, trying to quit though
karen:  if you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult
jim:  oh no, i didnt want to see you.not that im not happy seeing you, right now, im just saying ultimately i was here for the copier.equal, id say it was equal.so, good to see you
karen: 
jim:  i mean, its just that-  you know, pam and i are still dating, so, and, i just mean that things are going really well, so i didnt want to see… you
karen:  oh, things are going really well?are they?they are?thats great, thats so great.i wanna hear more about how happy you are with pam.can you tell me more about that?thank you so much for coming to utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you
jim:   alright, you are welcome.im going to go because of, um, traffic
karen:  traffic, yeah.oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm
jim:  i… will…
michael:  we tried and we failed.stanley, you may go.here is a box, for your things, but i doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.pam, im gonna need some help writing a want ad
michael:  um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass.big butt, bigger heart.  i cant do this
stanley:  michael?a word
michael:  of course
stanley:  i changed my mind, i wanna keep this job
michael:  really
stanley:  i wasnt really planning on leaving, all i wanted was a raise.how on earth did michael call my bluff?is he some sort of secret genius?  sometimes i say crazy things
jim:  hey
pam:  im so sorry, rolando told me everything.how humiliating.would it help you to return to another age?a time of refinement, and civility
jim:  are you inviting me to the finer things club
pam: 
andy:  oh-oh, come on
jim:   angelas ashes, top o the morning to us.frankies prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say i
oscar:  okay, did you get it out of your system
jim:  yep.no, i mean i really liked it.i thought was uh, a fun read
toby:  fun
jim:  mm-hmm
toby:  really
jim:  yeah
toby:  what was fun about it for you?was it the death of the twins
jim:  no, that wasnt fun
toby:  did you even read it
jim:  of course i read it
oscar:  how does it end
toby:  who was the main character
jim:  angela.nope.the ashes
pam: 
andy: and let me just add, that as a member of the finer things club, i would bring a strong financial contribution to any discretionary funds that we may have.finally, here is a recommendation from former u.s. senator rick santorum
oscar: okay, thats enough, uh.thanks, andy
andy: mmmhmm.
toby: hes gonna ruin everything
pam: oh, my god.his letter of recommendation from rick santorum is three fifty-dollar bills
oscar: wow.now we can afford hard-cover books
toby: i like it just us three. i dont want it to change.
toby: i love the finer things club.my ex-wife used to have a book club, and i would read their book and sometimes listen from the kitchen.
angela: the finer things club was not sanctioned by the party planning committee.renegade clubs are dangerous.i squashed the weight loss buddy support group.they didnt need to gather.it was just gross.
meredith:  i dont know why im not in the finer arts club .its bullcrap. you clean it up.
andy:  dear andrew bernard, after carefully examining your application to the finer things club, we are unable to offer you a position at this place and time.we would, however, like to place you on a list in case an opportunity arises when your inclusion can be tolerated.your position as an ongoing financial patron, however, is yours to cherish.sincerely, the finer things club. yeees! i got waitlisted.
andy: i got into cornell off the wait list.a lot of people were like, “oh, you just got into cornell because your dad donated a building.”no.okay.i got into cornell because im smart.im smart enough to have a dad who donates buildings to things
michael: utica is snoozeville, um, albany are the prepsters, nashua, no parking, um, akron is haunted, camden… is in a basement, yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in scranton, we are the cool guys.
michael: woo!shotgun
jim: well, youre driving, right
michael: yes, i am, but i want shotgun for you
jim: mmm… id prefer to sit in back
dwight: wait!i wanted to sit next to you
michael: no, dwight!dwight, jim is sitting next to me.youre gonna sit in the back leftwhere i dont have to see your ugly moongob
dwight: okay, that is so mean!you know what, im not going
michael: im sorry.im sorry.dwight, youre handsome.youre a very handsome man, get in the car.
dwight: woohoo!
pam:   so, there was no sales call
jim: nnnno.uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.but i think i fixed it
pam: wait, youre going along with this now
jim: i have to.pam, if im not there, someones going to go to jail.or die
pam: right.and, you wouldnt be able to talk to karen
jim: well, i promise you that has nothing to do with it
pam: a little bit
jim: well, yeah i dont want to see her get physically harmed, thats for sure
pam: because you love her?because you love her very much?
jim: all right, im gonna go now
pam: okay.have fun with your girlfriend
jim: okay, i will. 
pam: im kidding around.we joke about that stuff all the time.im not really the jealous type, so, i dont care if jim sees karen.i care a little.
security guard: they sprayed me in the eye.
dwight:  scranton rules!
michael: dwight!stop it!can you help me please, im being crushed.
michael: would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?like i begged you to?pam would have understood.heck, pam would have done it
dwight: pam is down for anything
jim: you embarrassed me
michael: you embarrassed us
dwight: yeah.we shoulda brought andy.i cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing
