andy:   everyone stop what youre doing, i have terrible news. dwight is no longer with us.
everyone:   what?! why is that?
andy:  hes gone, damn it! hes been promoted to vp of sabre retail and hes staying in florida forever.
angela:  so, hes alive.
andy:  yeah. that was him on the phone. he sounds wonderful.
angela:  well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
andy:  how could i have been more clear? he had a massive stroke  of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
phyllis:  if dwights not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
oscar:  you guys, weve gone over this, there is no treasure. 
oscar:  when the team left for tallahassee, dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure.  obviously he wants us to obsess about it. theres nothing in there.  which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. oh god, im wallace shawn in the princess bride.
andy:  i think that dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. 
oscar:  i am dying to know whats in there.
andy:  yeah, i know, oscar we all are but nobodys gonna open it. youd have to be insane. 
creed:  hi, hello.
andy:   now, carefully… open the box.
creed:   its a photo of all of us.
pam:  aw, thats so sweet! 
dwight:   a dart? are you kidding me? who would put a poison dart, well, i mean, i dont know that its poison. i mean, i just have to imagine. god, im glad hes ok though. kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another mans treasure and all. wow!
dwight:   well, mister ball, its been a pleasure. now, give my regards to hell. da! 
nellie:  oh, all right! well swung my vip vp.
nellie:  i am so happy dwight is gonna be working alongside me. we are a regular archibald and his man george.
nellie:  trick… theres no such thing. its not even a real english duo.
dwight:  ah!
nellie:  i just made you look like the goat of dover. and that doesnt exist either.
dwight:   you think youre excited? you should feel my nipples. 
jim:  oh, that reminds me.  little something from all of us. 
dwight:   oh my gosh, thank you jim, thats so thoughtful.  four!  oh yeah!
nellie:  he doesnt even care.
dwight:  dont even care!
jim:  this is the last time ill ever see dwight. its a weird feeling, its, um, whats the word? its not, its not bittersweet. its uh… sweet. yeah.
darryl:   hey, man. selling cookies for jada. want the same as last year?
andy:  would if i could. and i can so i will. put me down for one box. dont care what it is, dealers choice.
darryl:  ill put you down for shortbreads.
andy:  damn it.
toby:   knock, knock. hey, sashas first year in the troops, so im selling cookies for her. anyway, would you like some?
darryl:  no. no.
toby:  what?
darryl:  i been selling here for five years. this is my spot.
toby:  you cant claim territories. this is the only place i interact with people. cant you sell at your church or barber shop?  or chess club, or?
darryl:  you know what? its your first time, lets split the office. you can have sales, the annex, creed, and i dont know ill just take, uh, accounting.
toby:  thats it? yeah, well, ok. thanks darryl.
darryl:  ok, great.
darryl:   all i need is kevin. dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some.  when i first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. not a thin man, mind you. relatively thin.
erin:   hellosi, im home, babaloo.
elderly woman:   oh, here let me help.
erin:   i got it. it was so busy at the store today. really good cheese samples. i had, like, a hundred.
erin:  irene hired me as her live-in helper. we met at the store launch. i told her i was moving here and i needed a place and it just sort of made sense. i basically do everything for her.  i run errands. i do chores around the house. i cook and clean. honestly, i dont know how she survived without me.
irene:  when can i introduce you to my grandson? hes a wonderful swimmer. shallow end, deep end. he does it all.
erin:  well, today might be kind of tough, irene. i have to talk to my old boss, andy, and tell him im staying in florida. 
irene:   thank you.  oh, what kind of tea is this?
erin:  oh, i boiled some gatorade.
nellie:   ah. in england, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. well just chalk it up to cultural bias.
nellie:  oh.
darryl:   would you like to buy some cookies?
kevin:  cookies, eh?
kevin:   oh, the springtime thinks that its the best. and fall time thinks that its the best. cold time has, kind of a strut. and valentines thinks that its the best. but gather round, peeps, ill tell you the truth. nothing beats the cookie season, thats the truth.
darryl:   its not a scratch-and-sniff, kev.
kevin:  i know. but sometimes you still get a little something.
toby:   hey, you tricked me. you just wanted kevin.
darryl:  youre new to the game. you learned a lesson today. see you next year, sport.
toby:  no, no, no. its not fair. what if kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
kevin:  i do.
toby:  see?
darryl:  that doesnt mean anything.  kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
kevin:  oh, i definitely do.
darryl:   huh. hit the road, jack.
toby:  no, you hit the road, jack.
kevin:   hey guys, come on. dont fight over me.
toby:  you know, why dont we split the order? its only fair.
kevin:  no. wait, no. im buying, i make the rules. i actually do want you to fight over me. i wanna be wined and dined and… 69ed.
angela:  ugh.
kevin:  metaphorically 69ed. ew. perverts… no offence oscar. 
nellie:  hop in, we have places to be. no rest for the wicked.
jim:   all right. so… i guess this is it.
dwight:  well, jim, i just want to say that we havent always got along and at times, ive even hated your guts. but… bye, bye. i win.
jim:   goodbye, dwight.
dwight:   robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemens bet. woohoo! 
jim:  well, hes floridas problem now.
jim:  whats that?
jim:  i thought you liked the store?
jim:  thank you.
jim:  wow. when you put it that way, i guess it does sound pretty terrible.
dwight:   robert! im gonna win, ha ha, im the gentleman! suck it!
dwight:   the math is simple folks. deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise sabre   to the power of two.
nellie:  how did that look?
gabe:  im not just saying this, that was the best thing ive ever seen.
dwight:   i told you.
todd packer:  when you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how bout i pop up also? i guess wed have to say ‘power of three. hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works.  youd spin off right. id spin off-
dwight:  you know what? that is a great idea. cathy, write that down and print it out. its gonna make some really good toilet paper.
jim:   all right. there he is.
dwight:  what are you doing here? i thought i got rid of you?
jim:  can i just talk to you for one quick second?
dwight:  what, your stylist ran out of ‘messy spray? 
jim:  um, actually its, its for your own good. i think maybe we should- 
dwight:  you want to do something for my own good? turn around, walk out that door, do not stop til you get to scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. 
todd packer:  nice.  hey, halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like wooly willy?
dwight:   silence.
todd packer:  aw, im just trying to-
dwight:   i know what youre trying to do, i dont want it.  but your face does look like the guy from operation.
todd packer:  thats… thats the same guy. its the joke i made.
dwight:  different guy.
jim:  you know, i just think you should know that-
dwight:   that you look like the worlds tallest hobbit. 
jim:  well, i tried.  you saw it, so, its on the record. i have a plane to catch.
erin:  can you help me? im trying to make a video chat with andy.
irene:  just open the program and type in his user name.
erin:  can you just do it?
irene:   here, type in your password.
erin:  ‘erin123
irene:  thats a terrible password. and you dont ‘make a video chat, you video chat.
erin:   all right.
andy: hello?
erin:  thats so weird. theres something wrong with my laptop.  oh. i fixed it.
andy:  oh, now mines broken. hang on.  oh, there we go.
pam:   he said, ‘i did like dwight? hes gonna fire him.
jim:  no, no, i think it was more like, ‘you know, i liked him, but i dont anymore because he did a bad job, so im definitely gonna yell at him.
pam:  robert doesnt talk like that. you have to stop dwight from doing this.
jim:  i tried. he will not listen.
pam:  did you actually try your hardest?
jim:  yes… my pretty hardest. look, you havent dealt with him in awhile, all right. hes like super dwight. its like hes been bitten by a radioactive dwight, or som- stanley, back me up.
stanley:  dont talk to me.
jim:  stanleys very upset that were leaving florida. but he would back me up.
pam:  if dwights about to get fired, you have to tell him. just get the words out. thats all you can do.
jim:  ok. all right.
darryl:   whats a skinny guy like toby know about cookies? you cant trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. maybe toby from two years ago.
phyllis:   yeah.
kevin:  thats true. if i have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am i gonna call? darryl. tobys probably in bed with some model.
darryl:  thank you.
toby:  im, im not gonna comment on my personal life.
darryl: look, i need this. ok? your daughter is a pretty little girl. let her go door-to-door. you think people gonna buy cookies from my  chubby daughter?
phyllis:  oh. 
darryl:  baby, if youre watching this, youre not chubby, youre beautiful. daddys just got to sell some cookies. and were also gonna exercise more. its gonna be fun.
kelly:   oh, you know what you have to do? to decide? you need to make them do things for you. and, like, buy you things.
pam:  or have them sing that song! that the frog does in looney tunes.
phyllis:  make them kiss each other.
meredith:  make them kiss me.  
erin:  yes, this is too tan. this right here-
andy:  no.
erin:  this is a tanned spot.
andy:  i dont buy it. it, that is a freckle. that is not a tan, ok? im gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. i want you looking totally ‘puerto ricania when i see you.
erin:  well, andy, im not coming back.
andy:  what?
erin:  i have a job here. i work for an old lady. 
irene:   hello!
erin:  andy?
andy:  yeah, thats awesome. thats great.
kevin:   this is tough. ‘cause darryl, you sang better and you dance better but toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. i think ive reached my decision. i have decided… that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
darryl:  no, no, no, no. its not worth it.
toby:  no.
kevin:  no, its not worth it? thats too bad. ‘cause i was feeling particularly hungry this year.
darryl:  yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
kevin:  hungrier.
toby:  50?
kevin:  hungrier.
darryl:  youre not talking… triple digits?
kevin:  oh yeah, im talking triple digits.  again. 
dwight:   showtime.
jim:   dwight.
dwight:  you again? gosh, i keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. youre like an amish return stick.
jim:  ok, great, listen to me. listen to me.  no, no, i know. will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
dwight:  yes, you may tell me one thing. wait, you want to borrow money?
jim:  listen to me. robert is going to veto the sabre store.
dwight:   jim, come on.
jim:  dwight, hes gonna kill the store.
dwight:  uh-huh.
jim:  and then, im pretty sure hes gonna fire you for it.
dwight:  wait.  hes gonna kill the store? and hes gonna fire me?
jim:  yes.
dwight:   thats two things.
jim:  dwight, please.
dwight:  nice try, jim. your pranks have never worked in the past and theyre not going to work today.
jim:  ok, first of all, theyve mostly worked, so-
dwight:  you know what? you might want to get to the airport. its gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. bye.
jim:  dwight, come o-
dwight:  nothing is gonna stop me. that is the mark of a great man. unstoppability. dunder-mifflin, the farm, mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. now, if youll excuse me, i have a date with destiny. and from what i hear, shes a slu- ah!
dwight:   help! help!
jim:  gross! dont lick my hand! god, why is there so much saliva?
dwight:  ali had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
jim:  gross!
dwight:   ah!
jim:  what? what, what, what, what, what?
dwight:   oh, god! you… oh! my appendix-
jim:  im sorry.
dwight:  my wound hasnt healed yet.
jim:  im so sorry, i forgot.
dwight:  oh, man!
jim:  you all right? you ok?
dwight:   rrrah!
nellie:   where the hell is he? i cannot do this without him.
cathy:  i dont know. hes not picking up.
todd packer:  well, looks like shnoots a no-show. guess he wasnt vice presy material after all. but i am. put me in, babe. i got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. im your man.
nellie:   right, lets begin then. ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of sabre retail, mr. todd packer.
todd packer:  sup?
phyllis:   what are you doing?
andy:  im just dealing with erins stuff since apparently shes not coming back. and she didnt bother to tell anyone.
oscar:  we knew. ryan told us.
andy:  ryan, why didnt you tell me?
ryan:  thought you checker my tumblr?
andy:  you never update it.
ryan:  well, i updated it.
andy:  does anyone else think this is weird? and like, kind of uncool, actually? to leave us without a receptionist?
pam:  well find another receptionist. i mean, thats easy. well be fine. 
dwight:   huh, huh, huh! 
jim:  what are you doing?
dwight:  i was trying to go-
jim:  get up.
dwight:  ok, ok.
jim:  get up. all right? im not gonna let you by.
dwight:  then you know what? im just gonna have to run right through you.
jim:  ok.  what are you doing? are you really revving up? you know that doesnt work.
dwight:   jackie chan! 
kevin:   go.
darryl:   hi. this is alex.
toby:   and this is sam.
darryl:   kevin cant come to the phone right now because hes busy with us.
kevin:  perfect! now people will think im doing hot girls all day.
darryl:  i dont know, man, they might think were drag queens.
toby:  yeah, i dont know why you picked names that are also guys names.
kevin:  okay, now who do i ride to the kitchen like a pony?
toby:  dont make me be your pony, kevin.
darryl:  forget it, man.
kevin:  what do you mean?
darryl:  im out. and so is toby.
darryl:  this may be wrong. but theres a limit to what i would do for my child.
toby:  yeah. i have my dignity too. i refuse to be another mans horsey.
kevin:  no guys, stop! you have to sell me cookies. ill do anything.  im even gonna kiss meredith.  that is… hmph… thats ah… so good. 
jim:   what are you doing? no. no, no, no.
dwight:  this. ends. now.
jim:  this is dangerous.
dwight:   rrahh! 
jim:  why?
dwight:  anything else you need to talk about?
jim:  nope. i think that was it. 
dwight:   once again, its show time.
todd packer:  if i may speak to that, i have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is dwight shrute.
nellie:  whatever you do, do not blame todd packer. it is not his fault. blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. fire the employee, yes… but not the man. you may not cancel his soul.
todd packer:   are you kidding?  shes the queen of the whole freaking magilla!
todd packer:  what, you, i, i cant get fired. im an institution. i have been at this company for 20 years. how many of you have been here that long, huh? 
darryl:   hey, hey. theyre back. 
kelly:  dwight, what are you doing here? i thought you were supposed to be in florida?
jim:  yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. did you lose some weight?
kelly:  thank you, for someone who actually notices this. no, i didnt lose weight. but i started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. i actually put on five pounds.
phyllis:   hey! good to have you back.
stanley:   good to be back.
pam:   hey, stranger!
jim:  hey.
pam:  aw, i missed you.
jim:  i missed you. 
pam:  aw.
andy:  im going to florida to get erin.  forgot to turn off my email. its crazy, right? its just, when she said she was leaving, i felt so-  ‘youre about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue? yes. i am sure. ah, slow computer!
