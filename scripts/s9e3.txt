voicemail:  please enter your password.
voicemail:  you have one new message.
dwight:  how did you know? no! no, no! that is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
fake jim:  dwight, cut it out, im trying to work.
dwight:  you dont work here! youre not jim!
pam:  jim, i got us that dinner reservation. gricos at 7:30.
fake jim:  oh great, cant wait. 
pam:  jims at the dentist this morning. and steve is an actor friend of ours.
dwight:  i dont know who you are, but you are not jim. this is jim!
dwight:  oh my—! oh d—! oh, how did—?  huhhhhh!
erin:  heyyy! study buddies!
darryl:  oh, ok.
erin:  getting things done. awesome!
darryl:  its all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. life hacking, baby. this morning, i brushed my teeth in the shower. saved my self 90 seconds. which i just used to explain this to you. damn it!
darryl:  since andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, ive been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. in fact, you know what? lets knock out a few more of these sound bites while were here.  whoa! that person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
erin:   s”il vous plait…dites-moi…ugggghhh les bleagh!
dwight:  ah, french. its a great language. if youre a chain-smoking acrobat.
erin:  im just trying to fit in better with andys family. they all speak more than one language. usually when im there!
dwight:  you wanna learn a really impressive second language? try dothraki. win over any man in my guild.
dwight:  dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of essos as featured in the superb home box office series, game of thrones. it has a lot of nudity. which i fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
dwight:  i could teach you if you want. its a lot easier than french.
erin:  yeah!lets do it!
dwight:   atherozar!
erin:   oh!
dwight:  it means “excellent”. and we have begun.
pam:  . is everything okay?
nellie:  hmm? oh—oh, yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. fine, fine, fine.im mean, i d—i just dont wanna—burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
pam:  great.
nellie:  its just that i am taking my drivers license test in two days, and i need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. but ive had no time to do that, thanks to “demandy”….i just want to hit the open road and drive, man! but…in whos car?
andy:   nellie! get your wrinkly old balls in here.
nellie:  
pam:  nellie, i could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
nellie:  oh, pam, thank you! you are my savior!
nellie and pam:   ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
pam:   im sorry, im leaving you alone for lunch.
jim:  dont worry about it. i have a thing. a thing of soup. which ive been wanting to try.
nellie:  this is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesnt give you paper cuts. we cant. and here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
andy:  executive-summary me. hit the highlights.
nellie:  well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of michelle obama!
andy:  as in…
nellie:  wife of barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.
andy:   wow!
andy:  this is super-flattering. shes the most popular person in america. this is a big day for both of us.
andy:  my fellow americans, i have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. turns out, i am related to michelle obama.
erin:  i was intimidated by andys family before. and now i have to see the first lady at holidays? shes gonna be like, “whats your stance on politics?” or, “what is the best war to do?” and, i will just be like, “duhhhh!”
andy:  alright! we gotta get rid of all this junk food. get fit, america! not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh…im related to michelle obama.
pete:  yeah we noticed early on, andy really appreciates enthusiasm.
clark:  so we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
clark:  oooohhhhhhhh!
clark:  its starting to have this reverse effect, though, where i really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
pete:  yeah, me too. its weird. hard to remember whats real at this point.
clark:  just clap through it, man.
darryl:  you log in sales at ten different times. if you log ‘em all at once, you save a lot of time. its called batching.
jim:  that was really good, darryl.
darryl:  life hacking, man.
andy:  there he is!
jim:  andy, you gotta check this out. he just showed me—.
andy:   ahhhthathathathathta. right now i need canned tuna, okay? darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the first lady?
darryl:  tracee ellis ross. daughter of the first lady of motown, diana ross.
andy:  its me!  i am related to michelle obama.
darryl:  what?! really?
andy:  i mean, its distant, but…
darryl:   huh ha! thats cool, man.
andy:  right?
andy:  darryl said, “cool, man.” he called me as cool man.
pam:  you know, i really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
nellie:  mmmm—the thing is pam, im gonna be eating while im driving, so, i might as well get good at it.
pam:  brake lights. break lights! break lights! break lights!!!
nellie:  whhooooo!
oscar:  im just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
phyllis:  you think that andys family owned slaves?
stanley:  well somebody owned somebody. and i dont think anybody would buy an andy.
dwight:  i throat-rip.
erin:  foth aggendak!
dwight:  you throat-rip.
erin:  foth aggendi!
dwight:  he/she/it throat rips.
erin:  foth aggenda!
dwight:  more of a, barbaric growl.
erin:   forth aggenda!
dwight:  louder! youre shouting it from the back of a horse!
erin:  wah!! aggenda!!
pam:  pretty crazy about andy and michelle obama, huh?
nellie:   yeeeeahhhh! its almost unbelievable!
pam:  what?
nellie:  well, you know how andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
pam:  sure.
nellie:  well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, i remembered that news story about michelle obama having white relatives, and i just knew he would eat that up!
pam:  so hes not related to michelle obama?
nellie:  pam, i barely know how to turn on my computer.
pam:  
pam:  nellies pretty fearless. and i think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
nellie:   pam! .
pam:  
oscar:  well, if theres another explanation, i dont really see what it could possibly be. i—
andy:  whats going on here? im related to the first lady, okay? get over it.  i still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? get back to work! .
oscar:  andy! andy! no! i would be very polite today.
andy:  why? is it employees day or something? i cannot keep track of these bs holidays.
oscar:  your connection. to michelle obama has certain… negative connotations. most likely, your family were—slave owners.
andy:  does anyone else think its possible that i come from slave owners?
darryl:  whoa! that person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
andy:  hey mom, its andy. give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about americas national shame, thanks, bye. where were we? uhhhh, yes. okay. your…productivity thing.
darryl:  yes, yes, yes.
andy:  great. ooo! spreadsheets! yum, yum!
darryl:  i included some time saving ideas…
andy:  huh huh huh. look, im not gonna lie to ya, im a teensy bit distracted right now.
darryl:  look, andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldnt be your fault. this is only weird if you make it weird.
andy:   right on, brotha. wurddd.
erin:  addor!
dwight:  daraas!
erin:  qazer!
dwight:  daraas! does anyone here have fermented mares milk?
pete:  hey erin!
erin:  azem choma! chomakka-attun!
pete:  oh—okay. sorry.
nellie:  oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
pam:  yeah—turn signal. its exciting to be painting again—those are the wipers. so—the—its—just. there you go! yeah. yeah, things get so busy with the kids—red light—that its nice to have that creative outlet—red light! red light! red! red!
nellie:  that is brilliant, pam. i would love to see some of your work.
pam:  well, since were stopped at a light, uhhh, here is…the mural i did for angelas baby.
nellie:  thats amazing, pam! oh, i love the lion in the tuxedo!
pam:  angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
andy:  . heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?
erin:  vos!
andy:  so, no? you think maybe you could remind people? im trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
erin:  because of your slaves.
andy:  not my slaves, my ancestors. maybe. probably not.
erin:  well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for “slave master”, “attafrauk!”, is a term of respect. im learning how to speak dothraki! color you impressed?
andy:  that youre learning a made-up language from hbos game of thrones?i have a lot going on today…but this was a great nerd-out!
erin:  dwight, you didnt tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
dwight:  people laughed at klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
andy:  hi guys.
phyllis:  hey boss! i am so thirsty. could i have a scoop of water?
andy:  yeah. you dont have to ask me.
andy:  ha ha! okay. great. very funny. i get it. just because my ancestors happen to be—.very funny, kevin. changed my ringtone. very funny. i liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was “diamonds on the soles of her shoes” by paul simon, featurinnnngg lady smith—african american—mambazo.
pam:  good. very good. oh—no! here. its, uh, a text from andy. “new special proj. need fam tree for evbody. really dig up dirt a.s.a.p.” and then in parentheses, he wrote out “as soon as possible.”
nellie:  mm. ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. write back, “looking for dirt.”
pam:  oh, can i help? we could say someone is related to, uhm, tonya harding.
nellie:  pam, im related to tonya harding.
pam:  oh—gee—im—
nellie:  no! im just practicing my lyyiiinggg!  i love it.
pam:  brilliant!
nellie:  what should we say about jim?
pam:  ummm. oh! ill say hes related to richard nixon. its an inside joke. he looks really nixon-y when he wakes up.
nellie:  my ex behaved like nixon. all of the lying. none of the sexual charisma.  i just made a joke there.
pam:  im sorry. its just, uhm, i actually do have this weird feeling that theres something jim isnt telling me.
nellie:  oh no! oh! an affair! it is always an affair!
pam:  jim? no.
nellie:  . how can you be sure?
pam:  because he just loves me too much.
nellie:  youre a cocky little thing, arent you, pam?
andy:  ive done a little genealogy research of my own. turn out im not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol family closet. for example, phylliss great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the united states.
angela:  ew.
andy:  kevin is related to both john wayne gacy and john wayne bobbitt.
kevin:  and john wayne?
andy:  no. not that i see here.
kevin:  wayne johnson? the rock?
andy:  you mean dwayne? and no. what about jim halpert? uh oh! turns out, distant relative of the reviled, richard nixon!
jim:  pam always says i look like nixon. thats crazy, right? i mean theres nothing there. true— oh no.
andy:  dwights grandfather was a—.
dwight:  was a member of the bund. which is not technically the same thing as the nazi party. so…
andy:  i was gonna say he was a tax evader.
dwight:  oh. i was joking about that whole bund thing. oh ho, the look on your faces! hahhahahahahah! hahahahahah!
andy:  and meredith is a blood relative of lizzie borden.
meredith:  cool! ah! ah! ah! ah! 
angela:  stop it! stop it! youre frightening me!
phyllis:  andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
kevin:  yeah, that—youre being really mean, andy.
dwight:  yeah, andy.
andy:  no, im proving a point, okay? we all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. but its in the past and its not our fault. so we dont have to talk about it.
oscar:  the difference is, andy, that youre the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
andy:  mightve done. and how… do you figure?
oscar:  your familys rich! i have to believe that a big part of the bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
andy:  you know, theres nothing wrong with being successful in america, oscar! im not gonna apologize for my familys wealth. that wealth, could one day benefit society…if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.okay, kevin did that. i do not wish i was in dixie.hey mom, how are ya? did any bernards ever own a plantation in the south?she said no! take that!follow up question. did any bernards, ever, make money, in an unsavory way? i just asked you! why didnt you just say that? oh, stop! stop! stop talking! stop taking! thats—no! i dont wanna know that. ok. youre interrupting a meeting i have to go. love you. bye. well, turns out the bernards of yore did not own slaves.
oscar:  really?
andy:  we merely transported them. which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.
andy:  yo, d-dog. i need your help. im trying to think of things i can say that make it sound like i had a more difficult childhood than i actually had.
darryl:  youre gonna po mouth
andy:  exactly. help me po mouth, darryl.
darryl:  actually, andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions—
andy:  what if i said that my dad beat me. and, i just left out the croquet of it all. or, i could just go all the way and just say i grew up in an apartment. or is that too crazy?
darryl:  that could work.
andy:  you now, darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and i feel like im doing all the heavy lifting. im coming up with all the ideas here.
darryl:  im going for a walk.
andy:   okay.
pam:  good. good. and—
jim:  you doing alright, man?
darryl:  im done. i gotta get out of here.
jim:  yeah. not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
darryl:  its not just today, its everyday. it seems like the better title i have, the stupider my job gets.
jim:  oh, come on, it can always get better. right?
darryl:  hmm. yeah right
jim:  no, im serious. theres always something better.
darryl:  like what?
jim:  like hypothetically… if i said there was another job. that you and i could both have.
darryl:  what kind of job?
jim:  something cool. like, sports marketing or… that sound something like youd be into?
darryl:  hell yeah!
jim:  right?
darryl:  that sounds awesome!
jim:  ok, but wait. what if i told you that it was in philly! so youd have to…
darryl:  i love philly!
jim:  right?
darryl:  its not even a thought—
jim:  not even a thought!its not even that far away! i could still commute! exactly. exactly! alright!
darryl:  what? wait, wait, wait? so what? this happening?
jim:  oh, its happening!lets just keep it between you and me for right now.
darryl:  yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah. for sure. for sure. for sure. man!and pams into it?
jim:  we, uh, we havent talked about. but i think that shes—i think she understands… what this is.
darryl:  oh, come on, man. i thought you had something real.
jim:  what? no, no, no! come on! this is real!
darryl:  its not real… until your wife is on board.
pam:  so what did you want to show me?
nellie:  that is quite an ugly wall, isnt it?
pam:  yeah. its really ugly
nellie:  needs something, doesnt it? im thinking…a mural.
pam:  you mean me?
nellie:  yes! you! you are soo talented! its going to be my next special project. hiring scrantons most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
pam:  oh my god! i love it! uh, i—nellie, this is brilliant! hey!
jim:  hey! can i talk you? for a second?
nellie:  anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. she never loved you!
pam:  what?! no! i-i got this.  okay?
nellie:   this is his fault. it is not your fault. im gonna find you someone better, and rich.
nellie:  and filipino. but well break that to her later.
nellie:   you know what this is all about.
darryl:  yeah. you too, huh?
nellie:  yeah. go on, spill it. tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
darryl:  hey! he deserves this. and he said i could get in on it too. yeah.
nellie:  ohhh, pam, nooo! oh, i cant bear to watch this.
jim:  i dont know what i was so worried about. i have the best wife in the world.
pam:  i still cant believe he didnt tell me.
